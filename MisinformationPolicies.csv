 Senator Lankford [continuing]. And the maps that were put 
out. The maps were wrong. They were proven to be wrong at the 
end of it and my question to you is those that put out false 
maps and false information, what consequences have come to them 
for putting out false information to your office and to us 
because a lot of rural carriers spent a lot of money trying to 
be able to prove those maps were wrong. Those rural carriers 
will never be compensated for it and what I want to know, are 
there consequences for those other carriers that put out false 
maps?
    Chairman Pai. So the FCC staff has looked into that issue 
and going forward, what I can say is part of the reason why we 
started the 5G Fund was to focus on the wireless technology of 
the future, not to double down on 4G, given the behavior that 
we saw in the context of the Mobility Fund, Phase II.
    So going forward again, we have had open public dialogue 
right now that's ongoing about how best to make sure that rural 
parts of this country that are unlikely to get service from any 
major provider for 5G are not going to be left behind as we 
start to pursue C-band and all these other initiatives.
    It's really important to me that those small towns not be 
left out and stuck on 4G or no G as people in big cities start 
to take that for granted.
    Senator Lankford. Right. So are carriers that gave false 
maps to you going to have consequences for giving false maps to 
you?
    Chairman Pai. There absolutely are consequences for 
violating our rules. I can't speculate on what those might be. 
It would depend on the particular fact pattern.
    Senator Lankford. Okay. We just hadn't seen it yet. Again, 
I have nothing against those carriers, other than they gave us 
false information, and there's a consequence for giving out 
false information. There were real-life consequences all around 
the country. People are spending money to try to prove those 
maps wrong and it significantly delayed the roll-out based on 
what's happening. So there were real-life consequences on their 
actions. I want to make sure that that does not happen again in 
the future, that entities know give accurate information when 
you're asked to be able to give information.


 Senator Manchin. Okay. But if we don't have--I know--we 
keep having this discussion about mapping. We know the maps 
aren't accurate. We're relying on the carriers right now and 
the carriers are basically showing broad areas of coverage that 
they don't have and we've proven that and I would encourage any 
of my colleagues here to do your own and encourage your 
constituents to do their own tests and you will find out how 
starkly that they are misinformed on that and basically in 
error.


",Addressing False Broadband Coverage Maps,"Senator Lankford and Chairman Pai discuss the issue of false broadband coverage maps provided by carriers to the FCC. Rural carriers spent significant resources trying to prove the inaccuracies of these maps, with no compensation. Senator Lankford raises concerns about consequences for carriers providing false information. Chairman Pai acknowledges the issue and emphasizes the importance of accurate data, particularly for rural areas. Senator Manchin echoes the sentiment, highlighting the need for accurate mapping to ensure proper broadband coverage in underserved areas."

  Now, Pub. L. 117-2, the American Rescue Plan of 2021 was 
signed into law 2 weeks ago today. Among the nearly $2 trillion 
in spending was $5 billion allocated for Black farmers, $4 
billion of which was designated for loan forgiveness. Now, let 
me be clear. I didn't vote for this bill for many obvious 
reasons. The fact that the bulk of the multi-trillion-dollar 
bill had virtually nothing to do with COVID was chief among 
them. It was also drafted behind closed doors with no input 
from the Minority party. We never get the best product whenever 
either party allows that to happen. And moreover, the bill was 
drafted based on hypotheticals, misinformation, and incomplete 
data. Unfortunately, that is what happens when you force 
through partisan legislation through budget reconciliation. 
Paying off the loans of socially disadvantaged farmers may help 
in the short-term, but it does very little to address the root 
cause of this issue. I know my healthcare practice for 28 
years, we had to get to the root cause of an issue to truly 
address it long-term. I think that applies just as important 
lessons apply to legislation or dealing with public policy 
issues especially as egregious ones as discrimination within 
agriculture programs and the support of those. It does nothing 
to attack discrimination head on, and it certainly doesn't 
prevent racial exclusion for Black farmers, or any other 
socially disadvantaged group in the future.


 I received a telephone call from Mr. Lundy, Chief, Farmer Programs, 
to contact Mr. George E. Morris, Borrower, FmHA, Hwy Rt. 3, Lancaster, 
Virginia, who had received 1951-S serving actions to give assistance in 
filing FmHA package with County Supervisor. George E. Morris was 
contacted by telephone to obtain a statement on his situation. He 
indicated that he had been misinformed and needed help in dealing with 
the problem.
    On July 16, 1992, I visited Mr. Morris and held a conference with 
him and his wife. They are retired farmers with an indebtedness of 
twenty-six hundred dollars ($2,600) owed to FmHA and a four thousand 
dollar ($4,000) debt with Northern Neck State Bank, Warsaw, Virginia. 
They rent their farm land for twenty nine hundred dollars ($2,900) 
annually. Mr. Morris indicated that his son, who lives in the District 
of Columbia, helps in financial management of the farm. He had received 
a 1951 Service Action Processing package from the County Supervisors 
(office at Tappahannock) on June 6, 1992. He asked for assistance in 
filing package. (His package was completed to be returned to the 
County's FmHA Office.)


 Mrs. Sherrod, I don't have a question for you, but I am 
very familiar with what happened to you where somebody changed 
the context of what you said and you lost your job because of 
that, in 2010, and I am glad you won that suit against that 
news organization that ran that false article. I heard what you 
said and I saw what they reported, and I thought they very much 
changed the context.


  We have gathered evidence to show that loan mistakes made against 
socially disadvantaged producers are not mistakes, but intentional acts 
designed to cause foreclosure of farmland. Generally, a grant of 
equitable relief to a farmer is permitted, with limitations, in order 
to allow a producer to keep program benefits when the possession of the 
benefit is deemed noncompliance with statutes and regulations and such 
noncompliance is caused by the misaction or misinformation provided to 
the program participant by an authorized government official. See 7 
U.S.C.  2008a.; 7 U.S.C.  7996 (d); 7 U.S.C.  6998 (d), and 7 U.S.C. 
 1339 (causation based on misaction or misinformation). It is 
important to note that 7 U.S.C.  2008a. uses a different causation 
standard than 7 U.S.C.  7996 (d); 7 U.S.C.  6998 (d), and 7 U.S.C.  
1339.


 Others perceive racial motives in a place where Asians and other 
minorities are not frequently encountered. The Hmong stand out because 
few have learned English or assimilated decades after they began 
arriving in the U.S. from refugee camps in Thailand, where they were 
driven in 1974 after backing U.S. troops battling Laotian communists.
    The first few Hmong farmers arrived here in 2001 to buy poultry 
farms. Now Hmong community leaders estimate that 500 Hmong families 
operate poultry farms in the three-state region.
    ``I'm finding ethnic prejudice in all of this,'' said Jim Pate, an 
attorney in Russellville, Ark., and Vietnam veteran representing 
several Hmong farmers in bankruptcy court. ``In almost every case, when 
the banks set them up with these loans, they were preparing them to 
fail.''
    The attorneys and advocates involved stop short of alleging any 
conspiracy to defraud the Hmong farmers, or even direct collusion 
between the various banks and appraisers involved in all of the cases. 
And they acknowledge that some of the bankruptcies might be the result 
of market forces: The rush of Hmong to the region seeking to buy 
poultry farms bid up prices beyond what the inexperienced farmers could 
sustain.


 Current technical assistance is being provided to SEA farmers by 
nonprofit organizations and some investment corporations are strictly 
funded by outsider marketing people, new varieties of crops and 
management skills training, not from the U.S. Government. These 
programs, while providing data for the trainers and specialist to 
perpetuate themselves, do very little to help our farmers.
    Often those individuals who run these programs, reported to the 
USDA, as if they represent the SEA farmers when actually they don't 
even speak the language and knowing what the community needs.
    A good example of misinformation that caused major distress as 
follows:
    On January 12, 1997, the Department of Agriculture's Civil Rights 
Listening Forum announced a public listening forum. Our California 
Highlander Coop was not notified until January 15, 1997. When we called 
to reserve a seat to speak at the Forum, we were told that someone 
already reserved the rights to speak for the SEA farmers. The 
individual claimed that he spoke on behalf of the Valley's Southeast 
Asian farmers, but in fact he was from an organization based in San 
Francisco. He also was not even a Southeast Asian origin. Therefore, we 
request that from now on, there should be a direct contact between the 
SEA farmers coop and government agencies. This is essential to limit 
the mis-information and interpretation.


",Addressing Discrimination and Misinformation in Agricultural Programs,"The passage of Pub. L. 117-2, the American Rescue Plan of 2021, allocated funds to address systemic issues faced by Black farmers, including loan forgiveness. However, some lawmakers argue that while these measures may provide short-term relief, they fail to tackle the root causes of discrimination in agricultural programs. Instances of intentional misinformation and discriminatory practices against socially disadvantaged producers have been reported, highlighting the need for comprehensive reforms. Additionally, ethnic prejudice and misinformation have affected minority farmers, such as the Hmong community, leading to bankruptcy and distress. Efforts to provide technical assistance to Southeast Asian farmers have also been hindered by misinformation and misrepresentation, underscoring the importance of direct communication between farmers and government agencies to address these issues effectively."

 Federal support could significantly aid Illinois in our 
efforts to facilitate vaccination among hesitant individuals. 
The Federal Government should help mitigate and counter 
misinformation in the ongoing info pandemic that parallels the 
pandemic. This info pandemic fuels hesitancy and public 
confusion through the rapid and widespread dissemination of 
inaccurate messages. Knowing what is being spread and catching 
it early could allow IDPH and our many partners to respond 
swiftly to misinformation with simple, consistent, accurate 
counter-messaging. Unfortunately, current Federal funding is 
often restrictive and lacks the ability to rapidly reallocate 
those funds to address the emerging needs and crisis situations 
as they arise.
    Reorganizing public health funding is one way the Federal 
Government can help us implement the kinds of interventions 
necessary to refute misinformation and continue vaccinating 
hesitant individuals and populations.


 I think Dr. Ezike got it just right. Based on polling that 
I have seen, both nationally and certainly here locally, there 
is a small percentage that are anti-vax, that are never going 
to reach it. The vast majority of people that remain 
unvaccinated are still vaccine hesitant. So, when we sent out 
those Ambassadors into neighborhoods, going door to door, we 
see the ability to really address people's concerns, make sure 
that we are informing them of the facts because, as you know, 
there is still a persistent drumbeat of misinformation out 
there about the vaccine, about the efficacy of it, the 
ingredients of it, what was used and so forth. When we are able 
to have those kind of one-on-one conversations, we are able to 
break through at remarkable rates.


 And we have all the data that you want. For example, in our 
city, if you are a person of color 50 years or older, you have 
a 50 times higher likelihood of death if you are unvaccinated. 
When you start talking to people one-on-one about those kinds 
of shocking statistics, that catches their attention.
    But what we also try to do is draw out the misinformation 
that they have taken in so that we can disabuse them with the 
facts. But it really requires a lot of patience, a lot of 
listening, to go directly, and that is a lot of what the 
vaccine Ambassadors, the work that they are doing on a regular 
basis, and that is why I am proud of that program and why I 
think it has been wildly successful in bringing communities 
into care.


 Dr. Ezike, what can the Federal Government do to assist in 
increasing the vaccination rate? You mentioned something about 
disinformation or misinformation and social media. I would be 
curious about what are your observations there and what are you 
doing or what needs to be done by others to control that issue?
    Dr. Ezike. I think the infodemic, if you will, is a very 
powerful tool that is working negatively against the COVID 
response efforts, and I know most public health departments and 
other health partners don't really have the resources or the 
expertise to be able to monitor what the trends are in social 
media. So, by the time we are actually aware of some of these 
ideas that have just permeated and bathed the people, it is a 
very uphill battle to get on top of that because that news 
spreads so quickly.
    So, if there was a way that the Federal Government could 
assist with monitoring the information that is out there so 
that we can jump and seize hold of some of these mistruths and 
disinformation earlier on, before it has had such a chance to 
percolate throughout society, we could probably avert many 
people from hearing the wrong news, or at least having the 
counter-message be ready.


  We have plenty of information and misinformation. We have 
plenty of people blaming or pointing fingers at others in order 
to get their point across. The one phrase we throw around too 
much is to ``do your own research.'' This is dangerous. My 
background is that of a scientist. I have a Master's degree in 
Organic Chemistry from the University of Notre Dame. I know 
science and research very well. I spent the first decade of my 
career developing in-vitro diagnostic tests. I even helped a 
colleague develop one of the tests, IL-6, that helped identify 
the cytokine storm that saved my life. I have spent my entire 
career in science, but I am not a COVID-19 expert. I have no 
qualifications to do any research on this topic, and I have no 
capability to do my own research.
    One thing my background does allow me to do is read and 
understand the research and to put it into a translatable 
format for a general audience. Too often, a single line or a 
research article is taken out of context and used to declare 
the entire article or research study really meant something 
contrary to its findings. The world has a large number of 
people that are creating and sharing misinformation. What we 
don't have is enough people who are translating the research in 
full so that it can be consumed by the general population.
    In order to combat vaccine hesitancy, we cannot push the 
science. We need to bring empathy to the discussion to 
determine a way to allow everyone to follow the science.


 Mr. Foster. I would like to speak a little bit about 
vaccine hesitancy among parents of young children. Last week we 
achieved a significant milestone in our Nation's fight against 
the coronavirus when the first coronavirus vaccine was 
authorized for 5-to 11-year-old children. Yet, one recent study 
found that only three out of 10 parents of kids between 5 and 
11 plan to vaccinate their children immediately. Misinformation 
is a problem that can harm children even if it comes through 
their parents.


 One of the things parents sometimes are not taking into 
consideration is that the risk of their child is then 
transferred to them and the rest of their household. So, I 
think we have a lot of education to do and a lot of correcting 
of misinformation about the impact both at an individual level 
and, as we were talking about earlier, that this is not just 
about an individual, this is about our communities. This is 
about how do we protect our community more broadly than just 
the impact on the individual. Children have a huge role to play 
in that, and I think we have got to do it, and that is why we 
have dedicated November as vaccination month, to get this 
information out to parents so that they can be part of 
protecting whole communities while they protect their 
children's health, as well.


 Mr. Abram, what is the number-one piece of misinformation 
that you deal with, with regard to vaccines, that we should be 
aware of?
    Mr. Abram. Based on my experience particularly with faith-
based communities, one of the primary concerns is that the side 
effects would be really overwhelming and could even lead to 
unexpected illnesses or sicknesses, and that is largely rooted 
in a lack of education around the vaccine and messaging that 
suggests it is not safe or effective, which we know goes 
against science. So, we have been working with faith leaders to 
think about creative, innovative, and ongoing ways that we can 
reiterate the efficacy of the vaccine.

",Addressing Vaccine Hesitancy and Misinformation,"Efforts in Illinois highlight the need for federal support to counter vaccine hesitancy fueled by misinformation, often disseminated rapidly on social media. Reorganizing public health funding can facilitate interventions that provide accurate information, engage communities directly, and monitor social media trends to counter misinformation effectively and promote vaccination."

 There is also growing alarm around the world about the 
dismantling of Hong Kong's autonomy, liberty, and democratic 
institutions, the arbitrary mass detentions and other human 
rights abuses in Xinjiang, efforts to eliminate Tibetan 
identity, military pressure against Taiwan, and the assertion 
of unfounded maritime claims in the South China Sea. Other 
areas of concern include China's increasingly assertive use of 
military and economic coercion and state-sponsored 
disinformation campaigns including, among others, against 
India, Australia, Canada, the UK, ASEAN members of the European 
Union, and several other European countries.


 Concerns about Beijing's policies are fueled by a growing number of 
disputes and areas of concern. These longstanding areas of concern 
include intellectual property theft and commercial espionage (including 
through cyber-enabled means), unequal treatment of U.S. diplomats, 
exporters and investors, non-governmental organizations, social media 
companies, and traditional media outlets and journalists in China, as 
well as the abuse by PRC security services of the United States' open 
and welcoming posture toward Chinese students and researchers. 
Additional areas of concern include the dismantling of Hong Kong's 
autonomy, liberty, and democratic institutions, military pressure 
against Taiwan, arbitrary mass detentions and other human rights abuses 
in Xinjiang, efforts to eliminate Tibetan identity, and the assertion 
of unfounded maritime claims in the South China Sea. Finally, there is 
growing alarm in the United States and around the world with the 
Chinese government's use of military and economic coercion and state-
sponsored disinformation campaigns against the United States and our 
allies and partners, including, among others, India, Australia, Canada, 
the European Union, and several individual European governments.


 As Secretary Pompeo will detail, the U.S. approach utilizes the 
full toolkit of United States foreign policy instruments to push back 
the PRC's attempt to export its Communist model of governance. The 
United States is actively pursuing our policies through diplomatic 
engagement, public diplomacy, export controls and sanctions, countering 
disinformation and propaganda, foreign assistance, commercial 
diplomacy, trade law, law enforcement, and military deterrence.


 At the height of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, the PRC used 
government-controlled media outlets to sow propaganda and 
disinformation. China expelled respected independent journalists from 
the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post at 
precisely the moment when the world most needed objective reporting. 
While Beijing has imposed increasingly harsh surveillance, harassment, 
and intimidation against American and other foreign journalists 
operating in China, it fashioned its media presence in the United 
States and abroad into propaganda outlets that have operated with free 
rein. To reflect these institutions' actual relationship with the state 
and to gain greater insight and visibility into Chinese propaganda 
operations in the United States, since February the United States has 
designated the U.S.-based operations of nine PRC propaganda outlets--
including Xinhua, People's Daily, and China Global Television Network--
as foreign missions. This decision officially recognizes these outlets 
for what they are--entities under Beijing's control and outlets for 
Chinese propaganda. It also makes clear to ordinary Americans what they 
are not--independent media.
    In March, the United States clearly communicated the severity of 
our concern about the abusive, unfair, and non-reciprocal treatment of 
international press in the PRC. We capped the number of Chinese citizen 
personnel allowed to work for U.S. offices of four of these designated 
PRC propaganda outlets. The number of Chinese personnel allowed now 
more closely matches the number of American journalists that Beijing 
allows to operate in the PRC. This long overdue step towards achieving 
greater reciprocity with the PRC is designed to spur Beijing to adopt a 
more fair and reciprocal approach to U.S. and other foreign independent 
press in China.


 U.S. non-governmental organizations are similarly grappling with 
the PRC's increasingly assertive actions around the globe. This spring, 
I asked two leading democracy NGOs on each side of the U.S. political 
spectrum to share their thoughts on the state of democracy around the 
world in the wake of the initial COVID-19 shock. Not surprisingly, many 
of their concerns and recommendations centered on China and what the 
U.S. should do to shore up democratic principles globally. As one of 
the organizations recommended, the PRC must be held to account for 
hiding data, silencing internal critics, and engaging in a 
disinformation campaign. The other organization suggested creating 
programs to promote transparency by aggressively supporting local 
independent media, citizen bloggers, and watchdog groups to identify 
CCP propaganda and disinformation. While these organizations 
represented different U.S. political views, their commitment to 
supporting American policies that counter the PRC's growing 
disinformation and propaganda efforts were remarkably like-minded. The 
Department and USAID are doubling support for American and local NGOs 
to strengthen the voice of civil society and independent media, demand 
transparency and accountability, and combat disinformation.


At the Department of State, our China strategy is not just the work 
of a single office or bureau, but rather part of a comprehensive 
approach across the Department and our embassies and consulates around 
the world. The United States is working with governments to create a 
common understanding of the PRC's actions, to build a unified response, 
and to shape a long-term approach. This foundation is key to the 
growing recognition of Chinese actions that undermine global 
institutions and shared values; manipulate international organizations 
and silence of critics abroad; surreptitiously acquire high technology 
to further its military and economic ambitions; and spread of 
disinformation.


 We are also working with allies and partners to prevent the PRC's 
growing influence in international organizations. U.S. efforts to 
counter the PRC's moves to assume controlling positions to advance its 
parochial interests in these multilateral fora have accelerated over 
the past several years. Our efforts have included close cooperation 
with allies and partners around the world in the World Intellectual 
Property Organization's leadership election and shared interests in 
rejecting Beijing's efforts to insert language promoting the PRC's 
foreign policy and its core communist ideology into U.N. documents. The 
United States will also continue to pursue reforms that promote good 
governance, accountability, and transparency, which have the added 
benefit of making the U.N. more resilient to the PRC's malign 
influence.


 Mr. Biegun. We undertake military exercises together. We 
train for worst case scenarios and include deterrence in the 
suite of our strategies. We collaborate very closely on 
combating disinformation campaigns out of China. In fact, we 
have a regular coordinating discussion between me and my Indo-
Pacific counterparts. We started, in the early stages of the 
COVID crisis, a weekly conference call with deputy-level 
officials in the foreign ministries of six other Indo-Pacific 
countries, along with the United States all towards both 
sharing best information on the challenges posed by China and 
providing support for efforts to comprehensively combat it.
   

 I want to just tell you how much I agree with what Senator 
Romney had to say, the concerns about China, the cover-up and 
disinformation campaign on the coronavirus, destruction of Hong 
Kong's autonomy, unlawful military activities in the South 
China Sea, theft of American intellectual property, and then 
the terrible human rights abuses that we continue to see today 
against the Uyghurs and minorities across the country.
    

 Question. The Chinese Belt and Road Initiative has made inroads 
into Europe and has even signed an MOU with EU member Italy. I applaud 
the recent work done by the Development Finance Corporation and 
Ambassador Geoff Pyatt regarding the Elfasina Shipyard in Greece which 
I think shows how investment and diplomacy can be married to counter 
BRI. I don't however have a sense that there is an overall strategy to 
counter BRI in Europe, including working with Brussels and other key 
capitals across the continent. Do we have one? If so, what are its 
component parts?

    Answer. As part of the Department's strategy to counter the 
People's Republic of China's (PRC) malign influence, we have stepped up 
cooperation with our European Allies and partners and implemented a 
number of initiatives aimed at addressing the Belt and Road Initiative 
in Europe. Over the last 2 years, our diplomatic posts and interagency 
partners have greatly expanded outreach on risks to critical 
infrastructure and provided support to European countries in 
establishing or strengthening existing investment review mechanisms. We 
are working with our partners in the Western Balkans and Eurasia to 
ensure all potential projects are vetted to ensure commercial 
viability, transparency and fairness, and that national security 
concerns are taken into account.


 In February, Secretary Pompeo announced a commitment from DFC of up 
to $1 billion to the Three Seas Initiative (3SI) Fund in support of 
energy infrastructure projects, made possible in part by Congressional 
legislation adding flexibility to the DFC's mandate and allowing it to 
operate in high income countries in Europe within the energy sector. 
The Three Seas Initiative is a partnership of 12 democratic nations in 
Central and Eastern Europe intended to improve energy, 
telecommunications, and transportation infrastructure that bonds its 
members together and with the rest of Europe; the United States is a 
strong Three Seas supporter and partner, but not a member. The Three 
Seas Initiative is also designed to offer Western alternatives to 
infrastructure development that communist China might otherwise use to 
extend its malign influence via such projects.
    As needed, we are prepared to use foreign assistance funding from 
the Assistance to Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia (AEECA) account as 
well as other accounts to assist our partners in resisting 
unsustainable investments and loans, disinformation, and other forms of 
malign Chinese activity. The Department is reviewing over 50 proposals 
to counter malign Chinese influence from U.S. Embassies for projects 
from the current Congressionally-mandated Countering Chinese Influence 
Fund (CCIF). Ongoing projects funded by AEECA are already beginning to 
address this issue in several arenas, including working with energy 
sector counterparts to provide technical assistance and facilitate 
access to finance for key interconnection projects; helping to promote 
cybersecurity capacity development as well as greater cyber critical 
infrastructure defenses; promoting alternatives to Chinese goods in 5G 
and other emerging technologies; and helping to strengthen cooperation 
on nuclear energy with several European allies, in the hopes of 
cementing commercial relations with U.S. or other western firms in lieu 
of significant reliance on Russian or emerging Chinese nuclear 
technology.


 Question. Given China and Russia's opposition to extending the U.N. 
arms embargo on Iran that it set to expire in a few short months, how 
do you see increased bilateral tension with China impacting its posture 
towards extending the arms embargo at the Security Council?

    Answer. The United States has called for an extension of the U.N. 
arms embargo on Iran due to the Islamic Republic's behavior. The 
Islamic Republic has done nothing to deserve the lifting of the embargo 
and continues to send weapons to armed militias and proxies all across 
the region in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. Combating Iranian malign 
influence in order to foster regional stability and safeguard the free 
flow of commerce is a global responsibility. Irrespective of 
differences that may exist between members of the Security Council, 
allowing Iran to purchase and proliferate weapons would be an 
abdication of the U.N. Security Council's mandate to maintain 
international peace and security.


 Question. What are you doing to combat Chinese and Russian 
influence at the U.N. Security Council regarding Syria?

    Answer. This year marks the 10th consecutive year of a conflict 
that has caused massive suffering for the Syrian people. Working with 
our partners and the United Nations (U.N.) in support of the Syrian 
people, the United States is combatting People's Republic of China 
(PRC) and Russian malign influence on three different fronts: 
political, humanitarian, and chemical weapons. Over eleven million 
people currently remain in need of humanitarian assistance in Syria, 
including 6.6 million Internally Displaced People (IDPs). However, 
Russia has used its Security Council veto to support the Assad regime 
no less than 16 times, including 10 occasions on which it voted jointly 
with the People's Republic of China. The Assad regime continues to 
commit mass atrocities, some of which rise to the level of war crimes 
and crimes against humanity. Recent efforts have demonstrated that the 
Security Council is increasingly united in its support for the Syrian 
people, and in the process the United States and its allies are 
isolating both Russia and the PRC in their continued support of the 
Assad regime.
	 The United States continues to support the efforts of U.N. Special 
Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen in implementing a credible political 
process to achieve a lasting solution to the conflict in Syria as 
outlined in Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), and we welcome his 
plan to convene the third meeting of the Constitutional Committee in 
August. U.N. reporting continues to contradict the lies and propaganda 
of the Assad regime. The July 7 Commission of Inquiry notes the 
devastating impacts of assaults on Syrian civilians in Idlib Province 
by the regime and Russia, concluding that the attacks are responsible 
for 534 of the 582 confirmed civilian casualties and also finding 
numerous instances where attacks led to mass displacement. Working with 
interagency partners, the Department is aggressively implementing 
Caesar sanctions aimed at deterring malign actors who continue to aid 
and finance the Assad regime's atrocities against the Syrian people 
while enriching themselves and their families. The Department also 
continues to combat the PRC's attempts to insert its ideology and 
references to the Belt and Road Initiative into U.N. Security Council 
resolutions.



    Given Beijing's increasing use of economic leverage to extract 
political concessions from--or exact retribution against--other 
countries, the PRC may attempt to convert its deep investments in 
critical infrastructure into undue political influence and military 
access, while the energy exporters who rely on sales to China will be 
at heightened risk of malign influence. As countries attempt to shore 
up their balance sheets in the aftermath of COVID-19, they may become 
more receptive to an expanded Chinese footprint within their borders. 
Ultimately, the resulting deeper economic ties will create future 
opportunities for PRC firms to gain influence. In response, the 
Department of State is engaging regularly with leaders in the Middle 
East on a variety of critical issues, including problematic Chinese 
investments.


Question. The U.S. has spent billions of dollars investing in 
research battling infectious diseases in Africa. Last year it was 
announced that China is funding and building the new African Center for 
Disease Control in Ethiopia. That Center will be the site where U.S. 
research from across the continent will be consolidated, ceding 
billions of dollars and many years of U.S. research and funding to the 
Chinese: What is the State Department doing to stop China from building 
this new CDC? Do those activities include direct engagement with the 
Ethiopians on this topic?

    Answer. We are deeply concerned about China's plans to build a new 
headquarters for the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The United States has supported the Africa CDC since it was established 
in 2017. We are directly engaging the African Union Commission, African 
Union member states, and non-African allies and partners on this matter 
in a robust diplomatic campaign to make our concerns clear and 
underscore that African Union member states should make important 
decisions about where institutions are based, through an open and 
transparent process. As I mentioned in my testimony, we will continue 
to highlight the pitfalls of Chinese funding in our diplomatic 
engagement with African countries. It is in the interest of the United 
States to strongly support a robust Africa CDC, free of malign 
influence, that can help prevent, detect, and respond to infectious 
disease threats on the continent.





",Addressing Concerns about China's Growing Influence and Malign Activities,"The text outlines growing concerns about China's expanding influence and malign activities globally, particularly in regions like Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Tibet, Taiwan, and the South China Sea. It discusses China's use of military and economic coercion, state-sponsored disinformation campaigns, and efforts to dominate international organizations. The U.S. employs various foreign policy instruments, including diplomatic engagement, sanctions, countering disinformation, and foreign assistance, to counter China's attempts to export its Communist model of governance. It also addresses China's disinformation tactics during the COVID-19 pandemic, its control over media outlets, and the U.S.'s response to address the lack of reciprocity in media access. Additionally, the text emphasizes the importance of countering Chinese influence in international organizations and promoting transparency and accountability. The U.S. strategy to counter China's Belt and Road Initiative in Europe and other regions, efforts to extend the U.N. arms embargo on Iran, and combating Chinese and Russian influence at the U.N. Security Council regarding Syria are discussed. The U.S. engages with allies and partners, implements sanctions, and works to prevent China from gaining undue political influence through economic investments. Lastly, the text highlights concerns about China's plans to build a new African Center for Disease Control in Ethiopia, advocating for a transparent decision-making process regarding its location."

Certain manufacturers have exhibited substantive quality issues and 
even engaged in data manipulation. This issue is highlighted by the 
record $500 million fine imposed on the generics manufacturer, Ranbaxy, 
after it pleaded guilty to failing to report its drugs did not meet 
specifications. The firm also made false statements to the FDA. Ranbaxy 
knowingly manufactured drugs that tested out-of-specification, had 
unknown impurities, and would not maintain their expected shelf 
life.\10\


\5\ Eban, Katherine, and Sony Salzman. ``In Generic Drug Plants in 
China and India, Data Falsification Is Still a Problem.'' STAT News, 
October 29, 2019. https://www.statnews.com/2019/10/29/data-
falsification-still-problematic-china-india-generic-drug-plants/.

The data showed significantly greater falsification or manipulation of 
manufacturing data in Indian and Chinese drug plants. For example, a 
January 2019 FDA inspection at Indoco Remedies in Goa, India, uncovered 
that the manufacturing plant had faked the data in its batch production 
records to justify the release to market of its diabetes drug 
glimepiride.\6\ By contrast, the raw testing data showed that the drug 
did not meet quality standards and therefore should not have been 
released to patients.


 \7\ Eban, Katherine. ``Bottle X: Exposing Impurities in the Generic 
Drug Business.'' Newsweek, July 2, 2019.

The FDA's new inspection program exposed widespread malfeasance that 
had previously been hidden. By showing up unannounced, the 
investigators uncovered an entire machinery that had existed for years: 
one dedicated not to producing perfect drugs, but to producing perfect 
results. The investigators found a bird infestation at one sterile 
manufacturing site. At another, they found a facility's paperwork for 
its sterility testing in perfect order, ensuring that the plant's air, 
water and surfaces were free of microbial contamination. Yet the 
samples didn't exist. They were testing nothing. The entire laboratory

was a fake.


The hearing marked the first time that a top government scientist has 
testified candidly, and in unstinting detail, about the shortcomings of 
a federal response that, as Bright described it, has been dominated by 
politics, cronyism, and falsehoods, rather than science.


In a three-page statement issued this morning, HHS said it ``strongly 
disagrees'' with Dr. Bright's allegations, and accused him of working 
with ``partisan attorneys who are politicizing the response to COVID-
19. His whistleblower complaint is filled with one-sided arguments and 
misinformation.'' The statement also accused him of continuing to draw 
a government salary and failing to take up the new position offered to 
him. ``Rick Bright has chosen to stay home,'' the statement said.


In the weeks following their first phone call, as Hahn continued to 
assist Zelenko, the commissioner found himself a party to Zelenko's 
growing political entanglements. By April 26, Hahn had been copied on 
an email alongside Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and former New 
York City mayor turned Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. The email was sent 
to Zelenko by Jerome Corsi, a right-wing conspiracy theorist who had 
been investigated as part of the Mueller probe. In it, Corsi--who is 
involved in a for-profit telemedicine platform where doctors prescribe 
hydroxychloroquine--expressed his anxieties about the ``heavy legal 
scrutiny'' facing the drug.


Zelenko claims that clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine with poor 
outcomes are part of a political conspiracy from a ``corrupted'' 
medical establishment, and are ``clearly designed to fail and to 
substantiate a false narrative.'' Last week Trump claimed, honestly or 
not, that he himself had been taking hydroxychloroquine.


Corsi, who obtained a Ph.D. in political science from Harvard in 1972, 
is the best-selling author of books questioning John Kerry's war record 
and Barack Obama's citizenship. He briefly served as the Washington, 
D.C., bureau chief of Infowars, the conspiracy website run by Sandy 
Hook truther Alex Jones, though he later sued Jones for defamation. He 
became a target of the Mueller investigation as a result of his 
contacts with Roger Stone and his alleged foreknowledge of WikiLeaks 
document dumps. The Mueller team eventually declined to press charges, 
and Corsi sued Stone for defamation.


\47\ Secretary Azar, interview on Fox and Friends, October 2019.

While it is not always possible to combat all of the misinformation 
that exists, we encourage lawmakers to avoid, to the extent possible, 
repeating and sometimes promoting inaccurate information on quality 
that can potentially result in placing patients in harm's way by way of 
promoting non-compliance of their prescribed medication regimen. As FDA 
has emphasized, not taking one's medicine as prescribed by a doctor or 
as instructed by a pharmacist, due to unsubstantiated claims on 
quality, could have the undesired effect of exacerbating a patient's 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
illness or disease, and lead to worse health outcomes.


Strong regulatory oversight is needed to withstand disruptions in the 
supply chain. Strengthened oversight by regulatory authorities includes 
deployment of tools such as supplier verification and audits to ensure 
the quality of ingredients, along with track-and-trace mechanisms to 
determine drug and ingredient current and past locations. Risk-based 
analysis can help countries understand the most critical--or 
vulnerable--points in the supply chain. In the absence of tracking and 
tracing of products, especially as the supply chain diversifies, 
quality testing can serve as a last line of defense. During times of 
crisis, aggressive enforcement action by regulatory bodies against 
substandard and falsified products, unverified or false claims of 
treatments or cures, and price gouging, is needed to prevent further 
harm.
",Challenges and Oversight in Drug Quality and Misinformation,"The pharmaceutical industry faces challenges with data manipulation and quality issues, particularly in plants located in India and China. Examples include the case of Ranbaxy, which faced a $500 million fine for producing substandard drugs and falsifying data. The FDA's inspection program revealed widespread malfeasance, uncovering fake laboratory tests and other fraudulent practices. Additionally, government scientist Dr. Bright testified about political interference in the federal response to COVID-19. There have been allegations of misinformation regarding hydroxychloroquine, with political figures promoting unsubstantiated claims. Regulatory oversight is crucial to combat disruptions in the drug supply chain and ensure quality. Measures such as supplier verification, audits, and track-and-trace mechanisms are essential to prevent harm to patients and maintain drug quality during times of crisis."

Mr. Secretary, you stood by the President at the press 
conference and repeated false statistics about the therapy's 
effectiveness. Now the administration appears intent on 
politicizing a vaccine, with the President pressuring the FDA 
to approve a vaccine before election day and casting doubt on 
the agency's efforts to ensure that a vaccine will only be 
approved based on science.


 Mr. Secretary, we now are over the 206,000 mark for 
Americans who have died from this terrible disease. That's more 
than--more Americans than we lost in World War I, 53,000 Korea; 
33,000, Vietnam; 56,000 Afghanistan and Iraq combined; more 
than 7 million infected. We are the world's leader in absolute 
case count and absolute death count, and we are the world's 
leader, unfortunately, in COVID denialism and conspiracy 
theory.


 Mr. Raskin. OK. If you look at the chart behind me, the 
Institute for Health Metrics, University of Washington, has 
calculated that if 95 percent of Americans wear masks, we'll 
save roughly 96,000 American lives by the end of this year, 
compared to the current path we're on where there continues to 
be sinister disinformation and propaganda against masks.
    The administration has turned masks into a partisan symbol, 
discouraging many Americans from wearing them. We spent several 
meetings of this committee designed to combat the coronavirus 
epidemic fighting about whether Members should wear masks when 
they're not speaking in the committee, this committee, if you 
recall back to the early days.

around if the Administration will finally lead with the science 
instead of politics. That means committing today to end the

                    (A) moving rapidly to undermine Hong Kong's 
                autonomy, including imposing a so-called ``national 
                security law'' on Hong Kong;
                    (B) aggressively imposing its will in the East and 
                South China Seas;
                    (C) contributing to increased tensions with India; 
                and
                    (D) engaging in a widespread and government-
                directed disinformation campaign to obscure the PRC 
                Government's efforts to cover up the seriousness of 
                COVID-19, sow confusion about the origination of the 
                outbreak, and discredit the United States, its allies, 
                and global health efforts.


(13) Competition with the PRC requires the United States 
        skillful adaptation to the information environment of the 21st 
        century. United States public diplomacy and messaging efforts 
        must effectively--
                    (A) promote the value of partnership with the 
                United States;
                    (B) highlight the risks and costs of enmeshment 
                with the PRC; and
                    (C) counter CCP propaganda and disinformation.

SEC. 133. FINDINGS ON CHINESE INFORMATION WARFARE AND MALIGN INFLUENCE 
              OPERATIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In the report to Congress required under section 
        1261(b) of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization 
        Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115-232), the President 
        laid out a broad range of malign activities conducted by the 
        Government of China and its agents and entities, including--
                    (A) propaganda and disinformation, in which 
                ``Beijing communicates its narrative through state-run 
                television, print, radio, and online organizations 
                whose presence is proliferating in the United States 
                and around the world'';
                    (B) malign political influence operations, in which 
                ``front organizations and agents which target 
                businesses, universities, think tanks, scholars, 
                journalists, and local state and Federal officials in 
                the United States and around the world, attempting to 
                influence discourse''; and
                    (C) malign financial influence operations, 
                characterized as ``misappropriation of technology and 
                intellectual property, failure to appropriately 
                disclose relationships with foreign government 
                sponsored entities, breaches of contract and 
                confidentiality, and manipulation of processes for fair 
                and merit-based allocation of Federal research and 
                development funding''.
            (2) Chinese information warfare and malign influence 
        operations are ongoing. In January 2019, the Director of 
        National Intelligence, Dan Coats, stated, ``China will continue 
        to use legal, political, and economic levers--such as the lure 
        of Chinese markets--to shape the information environment. It is 
        also capable of using cyber attacks against systems in the 
        United States to censor or suppress viewpoints it deems 
        politically sensitive.''.
            (3) In February 2020, the Director of the Federal Bureau of 
        Investigation, Christopher Wray, testified to the Committee on 
        the Judiciary of the House of Representatives that the People's 
        Republic of China has ``very active [malign] foreign influence 
        efforts in this country,'' with the goal of ``trying to shift 
        our policy and our public opinion to be more pro-China on a 
        variety of issues''.
            (4) The People's Republic of China's information warfare 
        and malign influence operations continue to adopt new tactics 
        and evolve in sophistication. In May 2020, the Special Envoy 
        and Coordinator of the Global Engagement Center (GEC), Lea 
        Gabrielle, stated that there was a convergence of Russian and 
        Chinese narratives surrounding COVID-19 and that the GEC had 
        ``uncovered a new network of inauthentic Twitter accounts'' 
        that it assessed was ``created with the intent to amplify 
        Chinese propaganda and disinformation''. In June 2020, Google 
        reported that Chinese hackers attempted to access email 
        accounts of the campaign staff of a presidential candidate.
            (5) Chinese information warfare and malign influence 
        operations are a threat to the national security, democracy and 
        the economic systems of the United States, its allies and 
        partners. In October 2018, Vice President Mike Pence warned 
        that ``Beijing is employing a whole-of-government approach, 
        using political, economic, and military tools, as well as 
        propaganda, to advance its influence and benefit its interests 
        in the United States.''.
            (6) In February 2018, the Director of the Federal Bureau of 
        Investigation, Christopher Wray, testified to the Select 
        Committee on Intelligence of the Senate that the People's 
        Republic of China is taking advantage of and exploiting the 
        open research and development environments of United States 
        institutions of higher education to utilize ``professors, 
        scientists and students'' as ``nontraditional collectors'' of 
        information.
    (b) Presidential Duties.--The President shall--
            (1) protect our democratic institutions and processes from 
        malign influence from the People's Republic of China and other 
        foreign adversaries; and
            (2) consistent with the policy specified in paragraph (1), 
        direct the heads of the appropriate Federal departments and 
        agencies to implement Acts of Congress to counter and deter 
        Chinese and other foreign information warfare and malign 
        influence operations without delay, including--
                    (A) section 1043 of the John S. McCain National 
                Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public 
                Law 115-232), which authorizes a coordinator position 
                within the National Security Council for countering 
                malign foreign influence operations and campaigns;
                    (B) section 228 of the National Defense 
                Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116-
                92), which authorizes additional research of foreign 
                malign influence operations on social media platforms;
                    (C) section 847 of such Act, which requires the 
                Secretary of Defense to modify contracting regulations 
                regarding vetting for foreign ownership, control and 
                influence in order to mitigate risks from malign 
                foreign influence;
                    (D) section 1239 of such Act, which requires an 
                update of the comprehensive strategy to counter the 
                threat of malign influence to include the People's 
                Republic of China;
                    (E) section 5323 of such Act, which authorizes the 
                Director of National Intelligence to facilitate the 
                establishment of Social Media Data and Threat Analysis 
                Center to detect and study information warfare and 
                malign influence operations across social media 
                platforms; and
                    (F) section 119C of the National Security Act of 
                1947 (50 U.S.C. 3059), which authorizes the 
                establishment of a Foreign Malign Influence Response 
                Center inside the Office of the Director of National 
                Intelligence.


SEC. 136. SUPPORTING INDEPENDENT MEDIA AND COUNTERING DISINFORMATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) China is increasing its spending on public diplomacy 
        including influence campaigns, advertising, and investments 
        into state-sponsored media publications outside of China. These 
        include, for example, more than $10,000,000,000 in foreign 
        direct investment in communications infrastructure, platforms, 
        and properties, as well as bringing journalists to China for 
        training programs.
            (2) The PRC, through the Voice of China, the United Front 
        Work Department, and UFWD's many affiliates and proxies, has 
        obtained unfettered access to radio, television, and digital 
        dissemination platforms in numerous languages targeted at 
        citizens in other regions where China has an interest in 
        promoting public sentiment in support of the Chinese Communist 
        Party and expanding the reach of its misleading narratives and 
        propaganda.
            (3) Even in Western countries, China spends extensively on 
        influence operations, such as a $500,000,000 advertising 
        campaign to attract cable viewers in Australia and a more than 
        $20,000,000 campaign to influence United States public opinion 
        via the China Daily newspaper supplement.
    (b) The United States Agency for Global Media.--The United States 
Agency for Global Media (USAGM) and affiliate Federal and non-Federal 
entities shall undertake the following actions to support independent 
journalism, countering disinformation, and breaking the firewall and 
combatting surveillance in countries where the Chinese Communist Party 
and other malign actors are promoting disinformation, propaganda, and 
manipulated media markets:
            (1) Radio Free Asia shall expand domestic coverage and 
        digital programming for all RFA China services and other 
        affiliate language broadcasting services.
            (2) USAGM shall increase funding for Radio Free Asia's 
        Mandarin, Tibetan, Uyghur, and Cantonese language services.
            (3) Voice of America shall establish a real-time 
        disinformation tracking tool similar to Polygraph for Russian 
        language propaganda and misinformation.
            (4) USAGM shall expand existing training and partnership 
        programs that promote journalistic standards, investigative 
        reporting, cybersecurity, and digital analytics to help expose 
        and counter false CCP narratives.
            (5) The Open Technology Fund shall continue and expand work 
        to support tools and technology to circumvent censorship and 
        surveillance by the CCP, both inside China as well as abroad 
        where China has exported censorship technology, and increase 
        secure peer to peer connectivity and privacy tools.
    (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated, for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026 for the United 
States Agency for Global Media, $100,000,000 for ongoing and new 
programs to support local media, build independent media, combat 
Chinese disinformation inside and outside of China, invest in 
technology to subvert censorship, and monitor and evaluate these 
programs.
    (d) Support for Local Media.--The Secretary of State, acting 
through the Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, 
and Labor and in coordination with the Administrator of the United 
States Agency for International Development, shall support and train 
journalists on investigative techniques necessary to ensure public 
accountability related to the Belt and Road Initiative, the PRC's 
surveillance and digital export of technology, and other influence 
operations abroad direct or directly supported by the Communist Party 
or the Chinese government.
    (e) Internet Freedom Programs.--The Bureau of Democracy, Human 
Rights, and Labor shall continue to support internet freedom programs.
    (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated, for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026, $170,000,000 
for ongoing and new programs in support of press freedom, training, and 
protection of journalists.


SEC. 137. GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT CENTER.

    (a) Finding.--Congress established the Global Engagement Center to 
``direct, lead, and coordinate efforts'' of the Federal Government to 
``recognize, understand, expose, and counter foreign state and non-
state propaganda and disinformation globally''.
    (b) Extension.--Section 1287(j) of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (22 U.S.C. 2656 note) is amended 
by striking ``the date that is 8 years after the date of the enactment 
of this Act'' and inserting ``December 31, 2027''.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the Global 
Engagement Center should expand its coordinating capacity through the 
exchange of liaison officers with Federal departments and agencies that 
manage aspects of identifying and countering foreign disinformation, 
including the National Counterterrorism Center at the Office of the 
Director of National Intelligence and from combatant commands.


 (5) Contents of annual report relating to critical 
        technologies.--Subsection (m)(3) of such section is amended--
                    (A) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``; and'' and 
                inserting a semicolon;
                    (B) in subparagraph (C), by striking the period at 
                the end and inserting a semicolon; and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following:
                    ``(D) an evaluation of whether there are foreign 
                malign influence or espionage activities directed or 
                directly assisted by foreign governments against 
                institutions of higher education (as defined in 
                subsection (a)(4)(G)) aimed at obtaining research and 
                development methods or secrets related to critical 
                technologies; 


SEC. 205. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ENHANCING UNITED STATES-ASEAN 
              COOPERATION ON TECHNOLOGY ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THE 
              PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States and ASEAN should complete a joint 
        analysis on risks of overreliance on Chinese equipment critical 
        to strategic technologies and critical infrastructure;
            (2) the United States and ASEAN should share information 
        about and collaborate on screening Chinese investments in 
        strategic technology and critical infrastructure;
            (3) the United States and ASEAN should work together on 
        appropriate import restriction regimes regarding Chinese 
        exports of surveillance technologies;
            (4) the United States should urge ASEAN to adopt its March 
        2019 proposed sanctions regime targeting cyber attacks;
            (5) the United States should urge ASEAN to commit to the 
        September 2019 principles signed by 28 countries regarding 
        ``Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace'', a set 
        of commitments that support the ``rules-based international 
        order, affirm the applicability of international law to state-
        on-state behavior, adherence to voluntary norms of responsible 
        state behavior in peacetime, and the development and 
        implementation of practical confidence building measures to 
        help reduce the risk of conflict stemming from cyber 
        incidents''; and
            (6) the United States and ASEAN should explore how Chinese 
        investments in critical technology, including artificial 
        intelligence, will impact Indo-Pacific security over the coming 
        decades.


 (5) an account of efforts by the PRC to cooperate with, 
        impede, or obstruct any inquiry or investigation to determine 
        the source and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus, including into 
        a possible lab leak, or to create or spread misinformation or 
        disinformation regarding the source and transmission of SARS-
        CoV-2 virus by the PRC or CCP, including by national and local 
        governmental and health entities;


SEC. 241. STATEMENT OF POLICY ON COOPERATION WITH ALLIES AND PARTNERS 
              AROUND THE WORLD WITH RESPECT TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF 
              CHINA.

    It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to strengthen alliances and partnerships Europe and 
        with like-minded countries around the globe to effectively 
        compete with the People's Republic of China; and
            (2) to work in collaboration with such allies and 
        partners--
                    (A) to address significant diplomatic, economic, 
                and military challenges posed by the People's Republic 
                of China;
                    (B) to deter the People's Republic of China from 
                pursuing military aggression;
                    (C) to promote the peaceful resolution of 
                territorial disputes in accordance with international 
                law;
                    (D) to promote private sector-led long-term 
                economic development while countering efforts by the 
                Government of the People's Republic of China to 
                leverage predatory economic practices as a means of 
                political and economic coercion in the Indo-Pacific 
                region and beyond;
                    (E) to promote the values of democracy and human 
                rights, including through efforts to end the repression 
                by the Chinese Communist Party of political dissidents 
                and Uyghurs and other ethnic Muslim minorities, Tibetan 
                Buddhists, Christians, and other minorities;
                    (F) to respond to the crackdown by the Chinese 
                Communist Party, in contravention of the commitments 
                made under the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 
                and the Basic Law of Hong Kong, on the legitimate

Mr. Schmidt Thank you for inviting me to testify today on 
this very important topic. I am Philadelphia City Commissioner 
Al Schmidt. In Philadelphia, the Commissioners oversee all 
election operations in the city, from voter registration to 
election certification. I was first elected to this position in 
2011, reelected in 2015, reelected in 2019, and have overseen 
more than two dozen elections in my nearly 10 years of service.
    I am a Republican, and I believe that counting votes in our 
democracy is a sacred responsibility. For doing my job, 
counting votes, I would like to quickly share with you some of 
the messages sent to me and my family. ``Tell the truth or your 
three kids will be fatally shot.'' Included our address, 
included my children's names, included a picture of our home. 
``Cops can't help you.'' ``Heads on spikes.'' ``Treasonous 
Schmidt.'' ``You betrayed your country.'' ``You lied.'' ``You 
are a traitor.'' ``Perhaps cuts and bullets will soon arrive 
at'', provides my address. Names my children. ``RINO stole 
election, we steal lives.'' There are additional threats that 
my family asked me not to share today because they are so 
graphic and disturbing.
    I have three little kids. My youngest is seven years old. 
No matter what our party affiliation, this is not okay. Let's 
be clear: this is domestic terrorism. The whole point is to 
terrorize, to intimidate, and to coerce and to prevent our 
democracy from functioning as it should. In my case, this 
happened in the city where our democracy first began. It is not 
just threats. These aren't empty promises. Two men who drove up 
from Virginia were arrested outside of the Pennsylvania 
Convention Center, where election operations were consolidated 
in the 2020 election to, ``straighten things out'' and 
intercept an imaginary truckload of counterfeit ballots headed 
to the Convention Center.
    They were arrested with guns and ammunition and lock-pick 
tools. By the way, those two men were also arrested just across 
the street here on January 6th because of their activity on 
that day. They, like many others, were lied to and deceived and 
deranged by those lies. For what? To discredit an election that 
wasn't even close. Unfortunately, my experience isn't unique. 
My colleagues and staff received threats. Democratic and 
Republican election officials across the country have been 
subjected to similar threats or far worse. As a recent report 
by the Brennan Center and the Bipartisan Policy Center has 
detailed nearly one in five election officials now list threats 
to their lives as a job related concern. The threats rise in 
frequency and intensity each time election officials and bad 
faith political actors spread disinformation about the 2020 
election.


   Mr. Adams. Chairwoman Klobuchar, Ranking Member Blunt, 
Members of the Committee. Good afternoon. I am Michael Adams, 
Kentucky's Secretary of State and Chief Election Official. I 
was elected in 2019, but I got my start in election policy at a 
little intern desk in your hearing room 22 years ago. It is an 
honor to be back here, albeit virtually. Today we discuss an 
unpleasant topic, but the news is not all bad. In Kentucky, 
voting has never been as accessible nor as secure as it has 
been in the 21 months of my term. Last year, three months after 
being sworn in, I asked our Legislature to grant me, a 
Republican, and our Democratic Governor joint emergency powers 
to alter election procedures as necessary to ensure public 
safety in the pandemic without sacrificing voter access or 
ballot integrity.
    We made absentee balloting more available and extended in-
person voting well beyond the one Election Day Kentucky had 
from 1891 through 2019. The result was a primary election and a 
general election that each set records for turnout, yet no 
spike in COVID-19 cases deriving from the in-person voting. 
This approach proved so successful and so popular that our 
Republican controlled Legislature voted nearly unanimously to 
make most of these temporary changes permanent--early voting, 
an absentee ballot request portal, drop boxes, a signature 
secure process, and more. All this good news ironically lends 
itself to a higher level of frustration by me, by our other 
election officials, by our legislators about the unwillingness 
of certain quarters on both sides of the aisle to accept the 
reality that our election process is accessible and secure. In 
our current populist, anti-establishment political culture, 
part of this is organic, a reflexive refusal to believe 
anything somebody in the Government says.
    This is not unique to elections, as we have seen with 
lagging vaccination rates. However, part of this is not 
organic, but rather is driven by political actors who perceive 
some benefit in misinforming voters. Addressing this should not 
be a partisan issue because misinformation is not limited to 
one side. In Kentucky, we election officials were subject to a 
misinformation campaign that resulted in numerous threats of 
violence and other verbal abuse. The so called All Eyes on 
Kentucky effort directed against us did not come from 
conservatives concerned about voter fraud. It came from 
progressives duped into believing that we were engaged in voter 
suppression.
    Worse, this misinformation effort was given oxygen by 
senior figures within the national Democratic Party. I remain 
grateful to our Democratic Governor for defending our state and 
calling out these lies. I am not here to take political shots, 
to engage in moral relativism, or to diminish the experiences 
of Secretary Hobbs or any other election official. To the 
contrary, I am here to show that the problem is even wider.
    The first step in ensuring the safety of our election 
officials is to do no harm yourselves. Please keep your 
rhetoric factual and responsible. Misinformation is the most 
serious threat our election system faces because it is upstream 
of so many other problems we face: safety of election 
officials, willingness of election officials including 
volunteer poll workers to serve, voter turnout, polarization, 
and ultimately, the accepted legitimacy of our democratic 
system. Election officials are at risk, but we are not unique 
in this.


 Mr. Masterson. Thank you. Chairwoman Klobuchar, Ranking 
Member Blunt, Members of the Committee, I appreciate the 
opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the ongoing 
and pervasive threats targeting election officials, workers, 
and private sector employees who support elections. The 2020 
election placed election officials at the center of national 
attention in a way not seen in decades, if ever.
    Record turnout and a smooth election day validated election 
officials' incredible work. Their reward for this 
professionalism and bravery? Months of threats against their 
lives and the lives of their family members. The perpetrators 
of these threats are fueled by online conspiracies that cast 
election officials as malicious actors bent on meddling in 
election results. Innocuous glitches and human errors have been 
stitched together to fit broad, conspiratorial narratives as 
alternative explanations for election results.
 Recently, myself and a team of students at Stanford 
published an oral history of the 2020 election, where we 
interviewed folks like Commissioner Schmidt and Secretary Hobbs 
and election officials from across the country and the 
political spectrum.
    Virtually all of those who we interviewed shared stories of 
calls, emails, social media posts threatening them, their 
staff, and their families. For instance, Secretary Barbara 
Cegavske of Nevada, a Republican, shared with us that she and 
her family and staff were targeted with death threats regularly 
and even had drones flown over her house. Or Tina Barton, a 
local Republican election official from Rochester Hills, 
Michigan, received death threats, including one that made clear 
that when she went out in public, she would find a knife at her 
throat.
    As the bipartisan Florida supervisors of elections recently 
wrote in a memo to their voters, ``During and after the 2020 
Presidential election, the integrity of our democracy has been 
challenged by misinformation, disinformation, and 
malinformation that sows discord and undermines trust in 
America's electoral process. Many of us have been threatened by 
our fellow citizens, who have been led astray by these 
deceptions.''


 Mr. Henderson. Yes, Madam Chair. As we have heard from both 
Secretary Hobbs and Commissioner Schmidt, the courage that they 
have demonstrated in carrying out their responsibilities should 
not become the standard by which election administrators are 
measured. How can we possibly expect individuals, regardless of 
party affiliation, to come to the American people's rescue by 
serving effectively in their job as an election administrator 
when they face death threats that go beyond the norm based on 
disinformation that continues to spew forth in ways that 
corrupt the integrity of our elections.


  Mr. Masterson. Thank you, Senator King. Certainly, our work 
at the Stanford Internet Observatory and the work I did at CISA 
was to push people to the trusted sources of information about 
the facts with elections. That is your state and local election 
officials who have information about not only the security and 
integrity of the process, but the accessibility and how the 
system works.
    For us, one of the core recommendations that we have in 
combating the mis-and disinformation around elections is really 
driving and elevating the voices of our state and local 
election officials, as is done here in this hearing, to share 
the facts about how elections are run in the states. The fact 
that across all 50 states, our elections are bipartisan, they 
are transparent, and they are professional. 


 Senator Hagerty. I would like to try just a different 
topic. It has been raised already in these discussions today. 
That has to do with the reprehensible notion of threats 
surrounding elections, particularly threats to election 
officials, which I condemn at any level. Secretary Adams, you 
noted in your testimony that it has never been easier to vote 
in Kentucky. That is the case in Tennessee as well, where 
Secretary Tre Hargett has done an excellent job. We have had 
record voter turnout in 2020, thanks to his great leadership 
there.
    You noted that you and your fellow Kentucky election 
officials actually received threats of violence in 2020, 
resulting from a misinformation campaign by a left wing group 
that was egged on by national Democrats. Can you elaborate a 
little bit more on that unfortunate episode?
    Mr. Adams. Sure. I am not trying to target anybody or make 
any hay. I just want to note that this is unfortunately not 
limited to one side of the aisle. In this case, unfortunately 
there was a misinformation campaign that alleged that Kentucky 
was engaged in vote suppression, that it was some sort of 
intentional act by Republicans, namely me, to keep folks from 
voting, specifically African-Americans from voting--it was 
really reprehensible.


 Senator Padilla. Thank you. I think on a related front, we 
know that the Presidential election of 2020 was a fair election 
period. Joseph Biden was elected President of the United 
States, period. Donald Trump lost, period. Those are three 
factual statements. But even today, more than nine months after 
President Biden was sworn in, there are still many in the 
Republican Party who are unwilling to acknowledge these basic 
facts. Instead, a right wing ecosystem of misinformation and 
disinformation continues to perpetuate the big lie that the 
election was stolen.
    Many Republicans refuse to speak up against it. This 
question is for Mr. Masterson. Mr. Masterson, what is the long 
term consequence of these types of misinformation and 
disinformation campaigns, including how they relate to the 
security of future elections or voter confidence in elections?


 Mr. Schmidt. As a former senior auditor who believes 
strongly in the importance of audits when they are legitimate 
and when they are real and when they are carried out by 
qualified people who know something about auditing and 
something about elections, that is not what we have seen to 
date. In Pennsylvania, every county in the Commonwealth 
conducts an audit after each election. In most counties, 
including ours, we conduct a secondary audit that is even more 
comprehensive on top of that.
    The nexus between your question, the audits, or the so-
called audits and the threat issue are, I know in my experience 
and many others, the threats died down after Election Day, 
after the new President was sworn in. Now that the Legislature 
is talking about instituting some sort of bogus audit in the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, they returned. This level of 
activity rises and falls. It spikes and decreases whenever 
there is sort of this comprehensive misinformation and 
disinformation effort, both around election time and now around 
audits as well.


Senator Ossoff. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you to our 
panel. I appreciate your presence here and your answers. 
Secretary Hobbs, nice to see you again. Secretary Hobbs, this 
question is for you. One of the many destructive effects of the 
lies and conspiracy theories fabricated by the former President 
and his attorneys to discredit the outcome of the 2020 election 
was the dramatic increase in threats of violence, attempts to 
intimidate election officials at all levels.


Mr. Henderson. Thank you, Senator Ossoff. I should note 
before I answer that Georgia is also the state that has chosen 
to limit voters' access to water and food while they are 
standing in often incredibly long lines that result from having 
closed polling places that would otherwise have been used 
during an election.
    We know that housing discrimination still--it still exists 
in states around the country, and often polling places are set 
up in a way that particularly caters to a community of 
interest. Often, polling places that are closed would otherwise 
serve black communities, brown communities. It is a huge 
problem. The fact that you and Senator Warnock have introduced 
legislation that would seek to limit the ability of State 
Boards of Election to interfere at the local level to remove 
individuals who would otherwise and have served in a 
nonpartisan way for years but would now inject a level of 
partisanship in their responsibility, is something that for us 
is a huge problem.
    That is why we support the inclusion of the effort to 
protect against election subversion in the Freedom to Vote Act. 
This does have a real impact on individuals' willingness to 
trust the election, to feel that their votes will be protected, 
and even to turn out in future elections, which is really the 
purpose of many of these subversive laws. We think it is a huge 
problem, and we know that some of these issues, of course, 
existed because of the 2020 election. We have the big lie, and 
the emergence of misinformation and disinformation have 
certainly corrupted the integrity of the elections and the way 
some view that. However, as had been noted at the outset and 
questions that had been posed to the panel, truth is an 
antidote to much of this.


 Chairwoman Klobuchar. Very good, thank you. Mr. Masterson, 
we know that misinformation on social media platforms like 
Facebook is widespread, and there has been bipartisan pushback 
on this right now, whether it is the work that today we have a 
second hearing actually on this in the Commerce Committee with 
Senator Blumenthal and Senator Blackburn, on other platforms, 
specifically Snap and YouTube, as well as TikTok.
    We now know that in the new trove of documents recently 
came out that Facebook deliberately turned off election 
misinformation safeguards right after the election. They were 
worried the safeguards were slowing the growth of the platform. 
Can you briefly explain the severity of the problem of election 
misinformation spread through social media? Do you agree that 
this has been part of the problem with threats?
    Mr. Masterson. Yes, thank you, Madam Chair. Absolutely. 
This is one of the large challenges. Following the 2020 
election, the Stanford Internet Observatory released a report 
on mis-and disinformation targeting the 2020 election that 
looked at exactly this challenge and made a number of 
recommendations.
	The report highlighted the fact that individual platforms 
suffered from the challenge for consistent moderation of 
content around election and election information and promotion 
of correct or factual election information, again highlighting 
the voices of state and local election officials and also the 
cross-platform challenges that, you know, even if action was 
taken by one platform, a tweet would show up again, maybe in a 
YouTube video or posted on Instagram somewhere. There are a 
number of steps that could be taken.
    The first that we recommend is transparency around the 
data, the interactions with this type of content that the 
platforms can offer a lot more insight to researchers, to 
Congress, and nonprofits around the type of interaction. The 
second is consistent enforcement. Having your policies up on 
your platforms and consistently enforcing the rules around that 
in a transparent way that folks can understand.
    Finally, as we prepare for 2022, that continued need to 
highlight the voices of state and local election officials. For 
instance, search engines, Google could ensure that when someone 
searches for information on election information, the first 
thing to come up is the Secretary of State or local election 
website, as opposed to a trove of mis or disinformation around 
the election.
    I know many of the platforms and worked with many of them 
throughout 2020 to prepare. There was a lot of steps taken, but 
there is a lot more that could be done around transparency and 
support to state and local election officials to combat what is 
undoubtedly coming in 2022 and 2024.
    Chairwoman Klobuchar. Even beyond election misinformation, 
it has been just coming out more and more, I was seeing today 
the information that Facebook was--they changed their 
algorithms in 2017, I believe. That anger or any kind of 
emotion emoji was worth five times more in the spread of 
information than a like. I just want you to think about that. 
So, if you put some content out, Secretary of State, about 
elections or you put some content out about anything, that is 
just kind of factual, you know, you might get a like people 
agree with you. Maybe I put one out that Senator Blunt did a 
bill together. We did this. We did that.
 	You put something out that makes people angry, they are 
going to spread it five times more. I mean, that is a fact. If 
you can get people to do that anger thing and the anger emoji, 
then you are in for five times more the spread.
    I just want all of you to think about that in terms of, you 
know, you may have disagreements about, you know, what 
misinformation is, what it isn't, but that polarization really 
on both sides at that principle, when you have this dominant 
platform that is doing that, that can change literally dynamics 
in how people relate to each other, which I think feeds into a 
lot of what we are seeing. I don't know, Mr. Henderson, if you 
wanted to comment on that,
    Mr. Henderson. Madam Chair, thank you so much and I 
couldn't agree more with your observation. You are absolutely 
right. This disinformation, misinformation campaign has 
certainly undercut public willingness and acceptance of the 
election results as we know them to be. That is a huge problem. 
But I also want to point out that in some minority communities, 
many of the difficulties that we are talking about today with 
the attacks on election administrators are built on top of 
efforts that have already taken place in their states because 
of the elimination of the pre-clearance provisions of the 
Voting Rights Act based on the Supreme Court's decision in 
Shelby County v. Holder. Just two examples of that point.


  Mr. Henderson. I think your analogy, Senator Merkley, is 
absolutely on point. I think the argument that we are now 
dealing with a climate of fraud and insecurity about our 
elections, which is based again on the big lie, based on 
information that has been refuted time and again in a 
bipartisan way, not just by Democrats, but by the previous 
President's Department of Homeland Security, saying that it is 
the most secure election we have had.
    That kind of information is ignored in favor of the 
disinformation, misinformation, much of it found on Facebook 
and other social platforms, but of course, reinforced by 
statements of the previous President that somehow he lost the 
election through fraud, and that is used to justify harsh new 
legislation that has the effect of blocking black, brown, 
native voters, Asian American voters from participating. Even 
though those are the voters where we see the largest level of 
demographic growth in communities that would author--or rather 
provide voters at the polls. I agree with you completely.


 Senator Merkley. Okay, I am going put forward a theory, and 
then I am going to ask if you think it holds water. My theory 
is this that it is very easy to manipulate the vote on Election 
Day. By that, I mean, you decrease the number of precincts and 
communities you don't want to turn out.
    You decrease the number of election officials at those 
polling places so there is longer wait times and you can put 
out--probably not the election result, but others can put out 
misinformation about the location of the polling places. The 
elected officials can change the polling places from two years 
earlier, and even information has been put out at times that 
says, oh, we are so sorry, you missed the vote last week, so 
people think they missed the votes when the vote is actually 
the upcoming Tuesday.


 Mr. Henderson. Senator Merkley, certainly the organizations 
that I have been affiliated with have studied Election Day 
fraud in that context now. I don't know whether they have 
prepared a specific report. The leadership conference has not. 
But I think your point, which is that there is a history of 
misinformation on Election Day that is intended to dissuade or 
disenfranchise minority voters from turning out at the polls.


 Senator Merkley. I will just close with the notion that I 
would love for ACLU or other organizations to study Election 
Day fraud because I think it is very relevant and it is 
relevant to why vote by mail and early voting are so important 
because they take away the ability to conduct such fraud. I 
think far more Americans, millions of Americans are affected by 
those long lines or intimidation at a polling place, or 
misinformation about where a polling place is, or located in a 
place with no parking. There is many strategies, many forms of 
Election Day strategies.
",Testimony on Election Threats and Misinformation,"The testimony before the committee highlights the severe challenges faced by election officials due to threats, intimidation, and misinformation campaigns, particularly following the 2020 election. Officials from various states, representing both parties, shared experiences of receiving death threats and harassment directed at themselves and their families. These threats are fueled by widespread misinformation and disinformation about election integrity. Witnesses emphasized the urgent need for bipartisan support to combat these threats, protect election officials, and preserve public trust in the electoral process. Additionally, they called for greater transparency and responsible behavior from political leaders to counter misinformation effectively."

 To start, I would like to offer our perspective on the 
current global strategic context. As you note, 2020 was a year 
of turmoil, with a global pandemic drastically altering our 
day-to-day reality and increasing our dependence on the 
internet. Our adversaries took notice of our growing reliance 
on technology. Cyber criminals and nation-state actors alike 
took advantage of COVID-19 by unleashing ransomware on 
healthcare facilities, targeting vaccine production and supply 
chains, exploiting fears to spread disinformation, and even 
disrupting pipeline companies.
    As a result, the cyberspace domain is both more important 
and more contested than it has been in recent memory. Enhancing 
the security of cyberspace, both in the United States and 
around the world, is a top priority as the President's Interim 
National Security Strategic Guidance prioritizes cybersecurity 
and pledges to expand investments needed to defend the Nation 
against malicious cyber activity and cyberattack.
    Our competitors are using their cyber capabilities to seek 
political, economic, information, and military advantages, and 
to undermine our security by engaging in malicious cyber 
activity. The DNI [Director of National Intelligence] assesses 
that cyber threats from nation-states--particularly China, 
Russia, Iran, and North Korea--and their surrogates will remain 
acute, both in day-to-day competition and to seek advantage in 
armed conflict.


 In the past year, we have also seen influence operations by 
Russian entities to undermine confidence in the police and 
exacerbate societal tensions related to the police, so it is 
not a stretch to imagine that an adversary could use a 
combination of cyberattacks, like the one conducted by Babuk, 
and influence operations to undermine faith in public 
institutions further. In fact, Russia has clearly tried to do 
just that in our elections by hacking our electoral 
organizations while also running disinformation campaigns to 
undermine the public's faith in the process.


 Ms. Eoyang. Mr. Moulton, if I may. Mr. Moulton, if I may.
    Mr. Moulton. Yes, absolutely.
    Ms. Eoyang. It is something that the Department works with 
whole of government to protect our elections, and I think we 
are very clear with the public about the work that we do in 
this space. But we do not operate domestically, and so we have 
to engage with the rest of government to make sure that the 
American people are resilient to misinformation and 
disinformation, and we will continue to work with our 
interagency partners on that.


 Mr. Gaetz. Can our fellow Americans who are dealing with 
the impact of this last cyberattack assume that the imposition 
of some cost is what is being contemplated by the Department of 
Defense now?
    General Nakasone. So while I won't get into, obviously, any 
of the operations that are being considered, what I would say 
is that, you know, my role as the Commander of U.S. Cyber 
Command is to provide a series of operational opportunities or 
courses of action for the Secretary and the President to 
consider.


Ms. Houlahan. Thank you, Chairman. I really appreciate the 
chance to ask questions.
    This one is for General Nakasone, and it is nice to see you 
again. I am really interested in digital citizenship and 
digital literacy. I think it is incredibly important, 
especially in this time when we are, frankly, as a nation and 
as a world, unclear on where the truth lies. I am wondering if 
you could tell us how you, frankly both of you, are ensuring 
that your cyber professionals are trained on how to identify 
and root out disinformation. And if there is any specific 
training that you are using for your own team, is there 
anything that we could leverage or take advantage of to expand 
to all of the DOD employees to be able to educate them in 
sussing out the truth as well?
    General Nakasone. So, Congresswoman, I will begin, and if 
the Secretary wants to jump in. So I begin in terms of our 
work, we have a very, very structured analytic development 
program at U.S. Cyber Command that walks our analysts through 
being able to understand the information that is presented.


 Ms. Slotkin. Okay. And I guess, you know, this is more of a 
comment than it is a question. But along the lines of what 
Representative Moulton was saying, it is so hard to explain to 
the American public what we are doing to respond when they see 
these very visible attacks, whether they are from a foreign 
entity, ransomware, or whatnot.
    Our constituents, they are on the front lines of these 
attacks, and yet they can't feel--they don't know what their 
country is doing to respond. And I know that that is a 
difficult position for you all. What you do should be under the 
radar, but I would just note that there is a real sense that 
there is just no deterrence on a cyberattack, that a Russian 
group, a Chinese group can just attack us with impunity. They 
can steal a million records, you know, the SF-86 forms of a 
million Federal workers, and we put out a strongly worded press 
release.


 Mr. Morelle. Thanks very much, Mr. Chair, for this 
important hearing. And I want to not only thank you but thank 
the witnesses for their considerable contributions to the 
country.
    And, General, it is nice to see you. I had an opportunity 
with the freshman class in 2019 to visit with you at Fort Meade 
and was very impressed with the operation, and I know how 
critical this is.
    I want to just--and these may have been questions, as I am 
thinking about it, may have been asked in one form, but maybe 
you could just drill down a little.
    I have some questions about how private industry, the 
private sector innovation can help CYBERCOM address increased 
cyberattacks, whether they can, whether, in your opinion, some 
of those [inaudible] I know the private sector is working on 
it.
    Secondly is whether or not the command is well-positioned 
to implement cutting-edge technology from the private sector. 
So is it available? Is there help out there that you think you 
could use? Are you positioned to be able to implement help and 
resources and innovation in the private sector?
    And finally, are there obstacles preventing you from 
acquiring and implementing technology that we need to address, 
that we need to help you, you know, through the NDAA or other 
means to help you with a greater collaboration?
    And I would ask of both witnesses.
    General Nakasone. Congressman, just to start out, I would 
say that, is there initiatives in the private sector that could 
certainly help us? Yes, most definitely. And we see that. We 
are working with the Defense Innovation Unit. We are working 
through a series of partnerships that have been established.


 Ms. Eoyang. Congressman, thank you for that very important 
question. I think deterrence is certainly the Department's goal 
when it comes to cyberspace, but I think we need to be specific 
about what kinds of deterrents and against which types of 
adversaries.
    Since some of the activity that you referenced is what we 
would consider cyber espionage, and while we would expect that 
there is nothing that an adversary could do to deter U.S. 
intelligence-gathering efforts, there is likewise, we may not 
be able to deter adversary activity in that space to zero. That 
is not to say we can't impose costs, both by calling it out and 
making their lives harder, and engaging through other means to 
try and limit the scope of that activity. And I think that 
there are other ways that we can think about deterrence by 
denial.
    I would just note that in terms of cyberattacks that would 
rise to the level of an armed attack, we have not seen that 
type of attack from the adversary on the U.S., from a nation-
state adversary on the U.S. And we would, I think, continue to 
maintain a strong deterrence posture against any type of attack 
of that nature.",Congressional Testimony on Cybersecurity Threats and Response Strategies,"During a congressional hearing, General Nakasone and Ms. Eoyang discussed cybersecurity threats posed by nation-state actors and cybercriminals. They highlighted the increased importance of cybersecurity due to global reliance on technology, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adversaries like Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea continue to engage in malicious cyber activities, including cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns targeting critical infrastructure and public institutions. Members of Congress inquired about the Department's efforts to protect against cyber threats, enhance digital literacy, collaborate with the private sector for innovative solutions, and establish deterrence measures. The testimony emphasized the need for comprehensive strategies to defend against cyber threats and maintain national security in the evolving digital landscape."

In order to reach populations that have been disproportionately 
impacted by COVID, IDPH has been intentional about engaging hard-hit 
communities across the State with the most up-to-date information, 
answering questions and addressing any concerns people may have, 
particularly around vaccine hesitancy and distrust. False narratives 
abound--especially in our communities of color--and we must come 
together to create confidence and trust in the available vaccines. To 
this end we created a COVID-19 Ambassador program to support State 
efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 by enlisting individuals to 
promote and share information among their friends, family, peers, and 
neighbors on prevention measures, testing resources, vaccines and other 
relevant information.


 Promulgation of National standards and practices for contact 
        tracing, especially for data collection.
   Workforce expansion strategies for vaccinators and other 
        public health personnel, including deployment of Federal 
        personnel to Illinois as a force multiplier to our already 
        substantial but inadequate immunization resources.
   Intentional community engagement and education strategies to 
        promote vaccine science as a preventive method to thwart 
        vaccine misinformation and distrust for any future campaigns.
    Much has transpired over the past year; we have endured unthinkable 
loss and mounted a forceful response to contain the spread of this 
disease, save lives and rollout a massive effort to vaccinate our 
population.


 Mr. Cleaver. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for having 
this hearing.
    You know, one of the worst things that is going in this 
country, and I--you know, I have fear for my children and their 
children over the direction we are going. We try to politicize 
everything. It almost made me throw up to just hear the--you 
know, we have to politicize a pandemic. We politicize wearing 
masks, we politicize whether we drink bottled water or make a 
cup out of our hand, drink out of the faucet, drink out of a 
well. Whatever, it doesn't matter. We figured out how to 
politicize it and create some kind of a social battle on it. We 
have done it here. It just troubles me.
    But what I would like a guest, those who are testifying, to 
help me understand, is that, you know, last March, the 
President said, you know, we want to be back in church by 
Easter. In my real life, last year was the first time I wasn't 
in church on Easter in my whole life. I am usually there 52 
Sundays a year. Then he said it is going to be a great 
experience. I think when we start giving out false information 
it does damage.


 Mr. Swalwell. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you to the 
panelists. Many of us gathered last evening on the Capitol 
steps, House Members and Senators. We remembered the 500,000 
COVID victims that we have lost. As sad as it was to do that, a 
lingering thought I had was will we be back here shortly to 
remember 1 million lost? I think what we do as leaders on this 
committee and with our neighbors and people in the community 
will determine that.
    I want to turn to Dr. Watson and ask you a question, Dr. 
Watson, about misinformation. Because what we learn and how we 
act on that certainly will dictate future loss. We have seen 
harmless misinformation like mouthwash can stop COVID. We have 
seen harmful misinformation like ingesting bleach or 
disinfectants can stop COVID. We have seen reports of people 
showing up at emergency rooms because they have done this. So, 
what can we do to combat what is called infodemic? How deadly 
is infodemic to our ability to take this on?
    Ms. Watson. Thank you for that question. We have seen that 
misinformation, I think, on balance has had a very significant 
impact on public health and in the pandemic. As you mentioned 
from people taking treatments that are unsupported by science 
to not believing in the virus itself up until the point of 
death in some cases. So, I think this is a large factor in 
shaping how the pandemic evolved in this country.
    The WHO has proposed a research and policy agenda for 
combating misinformation, which really includes a combination 
of limiting its prevalence on-line and improving the reach of 
high-quality information that is health protective. But more 
research is needed into how we can effectively manage this. I 
also think that the United States needs a plan to combat mis- 
and disinformation especially as it relates to health.


Questions From Chairman Bennie G. Thompson for Crystal R. Watson
    Question 1. Many Americans are hearing and seeing a lot of 
misinformation in their social circles and on social media about 
vaccines and how they might be causing adverse reactions. Could you 
speak about vaccine hesitancy and share any recommendations on what can 
be done to counter such misinformation?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.",Addressing Misinformation and Promoting Vaccine Confidence in the Fight Against COVID-19,"The text highlights efforts by the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) to combat vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, particularly among communities of color. Initiatives such as the COVID-19 Ambassador program aim to promote vaccine science and disseminate accurate information. Additionally, there is a call for national standards for contact tracing, workforce expansion strategies for vaccinators, and intentional community engagement to counter misinformation. The discussion underscores the damaging impact of misinformation on public health and emphasizes the need for effective strategies to combat it."

Mr. McCaul. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. 
Secretary, for joining us here today.
    I've repeatedly said that Vladimir Putin is not our friend. 
In addition to last year's SolarWinds hack in my hometown of 
Austin, he and his cronies are responsible for at least three 
additional cyber attacks in the last 2 months, including two on 
U.S. companies which seriously disrupted our supply chain.
    He continues his illegal occupation of Crimea. He 
orchestrated the poisoning of Alexei Navalny. He publicly 
reports and supports the illegitimate despot Lukashenko in 
Belarus, even though he scrambled a MiG to hijack a commercial 
airliner to arrest the journalist, and he's holding two 
Americans hostage, Trevor Reed and Paul Whelan.
    Yet, late last month, the Biden Administration made the 
baffling assertion that waiving sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, 
a Russian Gazprom subsidiary, and its CEO and corporate 
officers is somehow in the U.S., quote, ``national interest.''
    Let me be clear. Allowing a Russian malign influence 
project to be built that will enrich Putin, give him greater 
strength in Europe, and further endanger Ukraine is absolutely 
not in our U.S. national interest.


    And with regard to our work on combating misinformation, I 
couldn't agree with you more. I think it's vital. 
Unfortunately, we have seen our competitors and adversaries 
engage in more and more of it.
    We have a number of tools to do that. One of them is the 
Global Engagement Center, where we have asked for, I think, 
important resources. I think we have seen success in its 
efforts to expose misinformation, whether it's coming from 
Russia or whether it's coming from China, and very much would 
welcome the support that you can give to that request.


 Mr. Secretary, sadly, American media of the left have 
become a propaganda arm of Hamas terrorists. Sickening proof, a 
page of the New York Times 10 days ago, May 28th, picturing 64 
dead children of Gaza and Israel, ignoring total Hamas 
responsibility.


 Mr. Wilson. Mr. Secretary, respectfully, this would have 
not occurred if there hadn't been rocket attacks. This was not 
just an incidental occurrence. The rocket attacks were the sole 
cause of the death of these children. And that's--it's not 
politics.
    As a former journalist myself, I'm just shocked that we 
would have American media be so complicit in promoting a false 
narrative that Hamas is not totally responsible. And you can 
only make so many--and I've been to Israel to see mothers there 
protecting their children. It's just horrifying. And so we need 
to be specific and go after the war criminals. Congressman 
Sherman was correct.



 Mr. Keating. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. 
Secretary. Thank you for the State Department's work, 
particularly with trying to free Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed.
    My question, first question is this. Despite sanctions, we 
have seen an escalation of attacks--cyber attacks in our 
country, disrupting the food production chain, disrupting our 
energy chain, and I have great concerns about that expanding to 
healthcare institutions as well, among so many others.
    Despite these sanctions, they are escalating and they are 
becoming more of a concern. The president has moved 
domestically to try and shore up cooperation with the private 
side. We're advancing a bill here in our committee for the 
Cyber Diplomacy Act. What can we do to better coordinate and 
what suggestions do you have for dealing with this great 
threat?
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you. This is front and center in 
our focus, the cyber threat writ large and, of course, its most 
recent manifestations in terms of ransomware, which is deeply, 
deeply, deeply concerning.


Secretary Blinken, the World Health Organization's abject 
failure to combat China's coronavirus--related misinformation 
campaign in the early days of the pandemic cost the 
international community precious time it needed to avert a 
crisis.
    The WHO remains a deeply flawed institution and is highly 
susceptible, as you know, to China's malign influence. The 
president's budget request includes an additional $124 million 
for the WHO.
    I want to ask you, sir, is this funding contingent on the 
implementation of stringent reforms that will prevent 
totalitarian States like China from co-opting global health 
policy to serve their interests? If not, what leverages does 
the United States have to secure these badly needed reforms?
    Secretary Blinken. Thank you very much. I very much agree 
with you that the WHO is in need of reform and that's precisely 
why the president reengaged the United States. It's very hard 
to be a strong advocate and successful advocate for reform when 
not only are you not at the table, you're not even in the room, 
and in your absence, who is at the table and in the room? Well, 
China, among others.


 Additionally, the CCP cyber attacks on U.S. military 
personnel information, the F-35, submarine bases, are well 
known, and China has deployed Western technology to supply on 
and oppress the Uighurs and have even conducted genocide 
against them.


 Mr. Barr. Well, Secretary, thank you especially for helping 
the Taiwanese with COVID there. And building off of the topic 
of strengthening relationships with Taiwan, I assume you're 
aware Taiwan lifted a ban on certain pork imports from America 
in the hopes of pursuing a broader trade agreement with the 
U.S. I believe deepening trade ties with Taiwan is important to 
countering Chinese malign influence.
    Mr. Secretary, what is the Administration's position on a 
bilateral trade agreement with Taiwan?
    Secretary Blinken. So I'd have to refer you to Katherine 
Tai, the U.S. Trade Representative. But I know we are engaged 
in conversations with Taiwan or soon will be on some kind of 
framework agreement, and those conversations should be--should 
be starting.


Mr. Allred. Yes, I appreciate that and I--you know, I was 
going to say you need to get back to me on this. I'm happy to 
work with you on it. You know, I think there's a lot of us who 
are concerned both with Iraqis and Afghanis who served with us 
and we're happy to work through anything that the Congress can 
help you with there.
    Turning now to a totally different topic, Mr. Secretary, I 
want to just quickly discuss the G-7 summit, the upcoming 
summit, and ask about cooperation among our allies to combat 
the misinformation campaigns perpetrated by countries like 
China and Russia that we all have discussed today and at 
length.
    Now, this is something that I've actually been working on 
with my colleague from across the pond, a member of Parliament 
named Stephen Morgan who represents Portsmouth, and it's deeply 
concerning to both of us.
    And it was, of course, great to see the development of the 
rapid response mechanism that found that misinformation is one 
of the key tactics used to undermine democracies in the West 
and around the world.
    These campaigns also have negative effects on vaccination 
rates, as you know, and have led to extremist violence, and I 
want to see if you could speak to what work the U.S. is doing 
with our allies to disrupt these misinformation campaigns both 
at home and abroad and whether or not that's something that 
will be discussed at the G-7.
    Secretary Blinken. Yes. The short answer is yes, and again, 
I really appreciate you flagging that. There was a preparatory 
meeting of the foreign ministers for the G-7 that I took part 
in a few weeks ago in advance of the president going, and this 
was very much on the agenda. It'll be on the agenda for the 
leaders.
    I'm very proud of the fact that the Global Engagement 
Center here at the State Department is the premier platform now 
for sharing information, including among our G-7 partners, on 
misinformation of one kind or another. When we see it we're 
able to share it, and to your point, and I know you've been 
focused and leading on this, having in place this rapid 
response mechanism is really important to be able to turn that 
information about misinformation into a practical way of 
countering it.
    And so we're--the department, the Global Engagement Center 
very focused on this, and yes, it will be on the agenda for the 
president in a few days.

","Addressing Cyber Threats, Misinformation, and China's Influence at the G7 Summit","The key priorities for the G7 summit appear to be addressing the escalating cyber threats disrupting critical infrastructure, combating misinformation campaigns from adversaries like Russia and China that undermine democracy and public health, and countering China's growing malign influence, including its co-opting of global institutions and use of technology for oppression. The administration is focused on better coordinating with the private sector to address cyber threats, leveraging the State Department's Global Engagement Center to share information and counter misinformation with G7 partners, and potentially strengthening ties with Taiwan to counter Chinese influence, including through a bilateral trade agreement. Overall, these issues of cyber security, misinformation, and China's influence are central to the G7 agenda."

proactive and routine healthcare practices. An estimated 1.6 billion 
learners across 144 countries--representing more than two-thirds of 
enrolled students worldwide--have been affected by pandemic-related 
school closures. More than 70 countries and territories have postponed 
elections. COVID-19 has exacerbated the global trend toward 
authoritarianism as leaders leverage ``emergency actions'' to 
consolidate power over democratic institutions. The number of protests 
and riots has increased, and around two-thirds of the countries where 
USAID works are affected by or at risk of violent conflict. Dozens of 
these countries have curtailed the right to peaceful assembly and to 
freedom of expression, with disinformation spreading rampantly. COVID-
19 has also disproportionately impacted women and girls, as public 
health lockdowns have increased the risk of gender-based violence, 
particularly intimate partner violence, and exacerbated the burdens of 
unpaid work, even as women are disproportionately represented on the 
frontlines as health care providers.


 Additionally, USAID is providing more than $75 million to date to 
support partner countries in preparing for COVID-19 vaccine deployment. 
This funding supports activities to build confidence and trust in 
vaccines, address vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, and support 
logistics and administration of vaccines. With additional funding 
appropriated under the ARP, and building on decades of U.S. leadership 
and expertise supporting global health programs around the world, USAID 
and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will expand 
this support, ensuring that vaccines reach the most vulnerable 
populations and those at highest risk, including health care workers.


 To further strengthen health systems, USAID is supporting country 
efforts to prevent, detect and respond to health threats. In 
particular, USAID supports coordination across the health sector as 
well as with other sectors such as education and water, sanitation, and 
hygiene (WASH). We mobilize whole-of-society efforts that include both 
the public and private sectors. USAID is also focused on ensuring 
communities receive quick, accurate information about COVID-19 and how 
it spreads, while combating misinformation about the virus. So far, we 
have reached more than 200 million people with critical public health 
information through mass media in more than 85 countries. USAID is also 
facilitating public forums about the risks of COVID-19. These 
communications efforts help save lives.


 COVID-19 continues to disrupt democracies by providing an 
opportunity for authoritarian regimes to tighten their grip, often 
through the use of ``emergency powers.'' To promote and protect 
democratic governance, USAID is supporting efforts to counter 
disinformation and defend human rights, the rule of law, and democratic 
safeguards. We have helped provide virtual platforms in some countries 
to ensure citizens can continue to monitor decision-making processes 
and hold their governments accountable.


 So May 24 the World Health Assembly is meeting. It is an 
opportunity for us to raise concerns and demand reforms. Of 
course, the World Health Assembly is the decision-making body 
of the World Health Organization.
    So I believe reforms are needed to ensure the accurate and 
transparent information sharing to members. Changes need to be 
made in order to address the vulnerabilities of misinformation 
and political influence.
    For the WHO to be successful in the future, it must earn 
back the trust of the international community and perform much 
better than it did during this crisis.


 Our global competitor, Russia, is engaging in a 
disinformation campaign to dissuade folks in Central America, 
South America, and elsewhere from using U.S.-delivered and 
developed vaccines.
    I am interested in talking with you about how we ramp up 
vaccine manufacturing both here in the United States and 
throughout the world, how we ensure it is delivered in as 
timely and equitable way as possible, and then how we push back 
on the disinformation campaigns.


Senator Coons. I would be interested in hearing from both 
of you how can we most effectively counter disinformation 
campaigns.
    Ms. Smith. Yes.
    Senator Coons. I have been really troubled to hear that 
Russia is actively engaging in a disinformation campaign to 
suggest that somehow American-sourced vaccines are less 
effective than Sputnik.


 While public health responses to COVID-19 are critical, they have 
also been exploited by authoritarian governments to violate and abuse 
human rights, engage in inappropriate or excessive monitoring of 
citizens, and to enable disinformation and hate speech. In particular, 
these responses have negatively affected freedom of peaceful assembly 
and freedom of expression. Governments have also used COVID-19 as the 
justification for arbitrary arrests, restrictions on access to justice, 
heavy-handed security responses, reinforcement of social divisions and 
discrimination, and more.


  Public health responses to COVID-19 are critical, but have 
sometimes been abused by authoritarian leaders and governments around 
the world to excuse democratic backsliding, including by suppressing 
political activity, violating and abusing human rights, inappropriate 
or excessive monitoring of citizens, and enabling disinformation and 
hate speech. In particular, these responses by some regimes have 
negatively affected freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of 
expression, but governments have also used COVID-19 as justification 
for arbitrary arrests, restrictions on access to justice, heavy-handed 
security responses, reinforcement of social divisions and 
discrimination, and more. USAID has responded to these challenges with 
a number of new short-term programs as well as adaptations to medium- 
and long-term governance, rights, and conflict programs. Rapid response 
programs provided human rights funding to specifically respond to 
COVID-19 risks and repression in areas including: freedom of expression 
and protections for journalists; gender-based violence, and the 
increased risks faced by women and girls during lockdowns; protecting 
the rights of persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples, LGBTQI+ 
persons, and other marginalized populations under threat during the 
pandemic; and preventing and documenting security sector abuses in 
enforcing COVID-19 regulations.


Question. What is your strategy for combatting Chinese and Russian 
vaccine diplomacy and COVID-19 disinformation?

    Answer. Since the early days of this pandemic, Russia and the 
People's Republic of China have spread disinformation, including about 
Western vaccines' safety and efficacy. We analyze these narratives and 
share findings with international partners to drive coordinated 
responses to foreign disinformation and propaganda. Despite efforts to 
undermine confidence in proven vaccines, there is clear, consistent 
demand for them worldwide. The United States will not share vaccines 
with strings attached. Vaccines are a key tool in ending the pandemic 
faster, and we are leading with COVAX and other partners to get as many 
doses to as many people as possible. We will work with partners to 
ensure equitable vaccine distribution based on public health data.


 USAID has provided more than $75 million to date to support partner 
countries in preparing for COVID-19 vaccine deployment. This funding 
supports activities to build confidence and trust in vaccines, address 
vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, and support logistics and 
administration of vaccines. We will expand this support with additional 
funding appropriated under the American Rescue Plan Act, building on 
decades of U.S. leadership and expertise supporting global health 
programs around the world. USAID and the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention are working to ensure that vaccines reach the 
most vulnerable populations and those at highest risk, including health 
care workers.

   Answer. At a time when democracy was already under threat, the 
COVID-19 pandemic has, in some countries, accelerated democratic 
backsliding and allowed autocrats to further consolidate power. 
Repressive governments are using emergency powers to excessively 
restrict freedoms of expression, assembly, association and movement; 
limit digital rights; and reduce transparency. According to the 
International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL), during COVID-19, 56 
countries have increased restrictions on expression and 141 on freedom 
of assembly. In addition, the spread of mis- and disinformation can 
erode trust in institutions and contribute to vaccine hesitancy. In 
fragile democracies, the response to COVID-19 is straining weak 
institutions and democratic norms and practices and impeding political 
competition. This can result in ineffective pandemic responses, less 
equitable distribution of resources, weakening of human and labor 
rights, diminished rule of law, and increased corruption. These 
deficiencies could undermine public trust in the Government and foment 
conflict.
    Fortunately, the resilience of democratic governments, robust and 
innovative responses by civil society, and reinvigorated protest 
activity provide fertile ground for democracy assistance. Since last 
year, we have made rapid adaptations and started new programs across 
USAID to directly respond to backsliding in the context of COVID. More 
generally, USAID programs are supporting civil society around the world 
to monitor and expose encroachment on rights and advocate for 
democratic reforms; supporting independent media by expanding skills 
and legal protections for investigative journalists; and promoting 
efforts to combat disinformation and hate speech by government regimes, 
malign actors, and non-state actors and to disseminate accurate public 
health information.",USAID's Efforts in Combatting Disinformation and Addressing COVID-19 Impacts,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is actively engaged in addressing the multifaceted challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. From combating disinformation and vaccine hesitancy to countering authoritarianism, USAID is deploying a comprehensive strategy to promote global health, human rights, and democratic governance. Through funding initiatives, public health campaigns, and support for civil society, USAID is working to ensure equitable vaccine distribution, strengthen health systems, defend democratic principles, and combat misinformation spread by foreign adversaries. Amidst the pandemic's disruptions, USAID remains committed to advancing its mission of promoting stability, prosperity, and democratic values worldwide."

 In mid-April, Donald Trump called reports of PPE shortages 
``fake news.'' On May 6th, a nurse told reporters gathered in 
the Oval Office that the availability of PPE was sporadic. 
Donald Trump said--and this was in the Oval Office--Donald 
Trump said: ``Sporadic for you, but not sporadic for a lot of 
other people. I've heard we have a tremendous supply in almost 
all places.''
    Just last week, Donald Trump said, ``My administration 
currently has zero unfilled requests for equipment, for 
anything else that they need from the Governors. We are stocked 
up and ready to go.''
    So those are the facts. And the statements that the 
President has made are just wrong, wrong, wrong.


  Today I am focused on the critical issue of the U.S. supply 
chain during the pandemic, and specifically counterfeit PPE in 
the gray market that exploits hospitals, patients, and the 
government with false and often harmful claims of having 
medical supplies to offer.


The first is that the safety and effectiveness of the PPE 
used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic have been compromised, 
most notably by incredible increases in opportunistic market 
behavior such as counterfeits, fakes, and fraudulent products.
    The second is that the ability of the industry to get the 
equipment to the people who need it, both in terms of the gross 
amount of product and the systems which efficiently distribute 
the products to the end users, has been sorely tested. We have 
submitted detailed testimony which outlines our experience and 
our recommendations in these areas. I would like to highlight 
just a few.
    The safety equipment industry is built on a foundation of 
standardization and trust. Standardized performance is central 
to the value of the PPE we provide to the wearer. They must 
understand the parameters of performance for this equipment, 
and they must trust that it will occur when needed.
    Fake, fraudulent, and counterfeit products erode and steal 
that trust. These illegal products do not just harm the 
financial interests of our members, they put the end user at 
risk of injury, sickness, and death. The various efforts to 
control these activities range from the public sector to the 
private.


 In the U.S. market, the CDC and other agencies have stepped 
in to surveil the market and to identify fraudulent products. 
Our own companies have policed the market. 3M Company has taken 
down 10,000 false and deceptive social media posts, removed 
7,000 fraudulent e-commerce offerings, and removed more than 
140 deceptive Internet addresses.
    Despite these efforts, these practices persist. ISEA 
supports in general the National Association of Manufacturers 
anti-counterfeiting efforts, which we have detailed in our 
comments. It is not just about the products; it is also about 
the platforms they are sold on.


That brings us to why we are here today--focusing on the critical 
issue of counterfeit PPE, the so-called ``gray market'' of brokers and 
supplies, and how at a time of grave need there were, and are, 
individuals and organizations looking to exploit health-care providers, 
the patients they serve, and the government with their false and often 
harmful claims of having appropriate medical supplies to offer.


  Which brings us to why we are here today--to expose the predatory 
practices of those looking to exploit this vulnerability by making 
false promises and offering unsafe, exorbitantly priced medical 
supplies to healthcare providers throughout the country, and to work 
together to collectively find ways to prevent these practices in the 
future.


 First, our member, Yale New Haven Health in Connecticut, 
experienced an ongoing issue with N95 respirators. In late March they 
became aware that there may be counterfeit Dasheng KN95 respirators. 
Combing through donations they had received, they found a significant 
number of these counterfeit respirators. Of course, they also had open 
orders at the time for these Dasheng KN95s so they immediately canceled 
those. Yale later learned that most of the PPE vendors with whom they 
had been engaging were not actually dealing directly with factories in 
China but, rather, third party distributors or grey market brokers. 
Their concern around these counterfeit products led them to cancel 
orders they had placed directly with the Dasheng factory. Throughout 
this crisis, Yale discovered that many vendors had sent false test 
results, prompting Yale to send some of their KN95s out to a third 
party testing lab--turns out they were barely 85 percent efficient--
leading Yale to become even more skeptical of these vendors and their 
product.


 Indeed, during our first hearing we heard that DHS is engaged in a 
whole-of-
government response to combat the virus and is working with its 
Federal, State, local, tribal, and international partners in a unified 
effort to ensure the integrity of our Nation's supply chain. For 
example, we heard from Homeland Security Investigations on their 
efforts to prevent and investigate criminal activity surrounding the 
pandemic, and how they seized hundreds of items of fake and faulty 
personal protective equipment and returned over $17 million dollars to 
victims of COVID-19 fraud. We also heard from DHS's Chief Procurement 
Office on their efforts to cut bureaucratic red tape so that FEMA could 
easily procure larger volumes of emergency services and supplies.

    These are things that front-line workers desperately need, and DHS 
answered the call by working with industry to review and vet companies 
offering COVID-19 solutions to the Federal Government. I want to 
highlight that this continues to be an incredible challenge, as 
thousands of unscrupulous sellers claim to be able to produce safe and 
legitimate supplies when what they are actually selling is fake and 
faulty.


2.  Fraudulent products make false claims about their 
certifications, or the bodies that have provided testing.


 ISEA has previously brought these issues to the attention of 
various US agencies, including Department of Commerce, Customs and 
Border Control, and OSHA, and we will continue to explore solutions. As 
discussed below, the industry has seen an increase in false claims tied 
to standards during the COVID-19 pandemic. ISEA and its members 
continue to explore policy solutions for the issue of nonperforming 
PPE, and we recommend that this issue be addressed by future 
counterfeiting initiatives recommended below
Counterfeits, Fakes, and Frauds
    ISEA welcomes the committee's focus on Protecting the Reliability 
of the U.S. Medical Supply Chain During the COVID-19 pandemic. ISEA is 
proud to be a member of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) 
and we would like to associate ourselves its recent call to action, 
``Countering Counterfeits: The Real Threat of Fake Products,'' to 
battle against counterfeit goods, across the board.\1\


 role of dhs in preventing harmful imports
    First, ISEA applauds Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) and Homeland 
Security Investigations (HSI) for the agencies' dedication to stopping 
fraudulently marked and counterfeit COVID-19-related products from 
entering the U.S. Fakes, frauds, and counterfeits have always plagued 
the PPE sector, and these illegal products don't just harm the 
financial interest and the brand trust of our members, they put users 
at risk of injury, sickness, and death.

    The Association understands that while most seizures during the 
COVID-19 pandemic are of illicit respirators and surgical masks, 
additional types of PPE interdicted by Federal authorities include 
clear face shields, safety goggles, protective suits, gloves, medical 
gowns, and protective shoe coverings. A wide range of other fraudulent 
COVID-19-related items have also been identified and seized. This 
process works, but it can work better, as we note below with a few 
suggestions.
          isea member efforts to prevent illegitimate imports
    Supplementing the work of DHS, ISEA members view the import of 
fraudulently marked and counterfeited PPE seriously. For example, 3M 
Company has: (1) taken down 10,000 false and deceptive social media 
posts; (2) removed 7,000 fraudulent e-commerce offerings; (3) removed 
more than 140 deceptive Internet addresses; and (4) more.\2\ The 
company is also investing in ways to identify fraudulently marked and 
counterfeited products. It is not just large companies that are the 
victims of this nefarious activity--but the largest companies are able 
to devote significant resources to protecting their brands, and the 
safety of their products.


national institute of occupational safety and health, ppe manufacturers 
           inform end-users of fake or fraudulent respirators
    In addition to CBP and HSI, the National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health (NIOSH) National Personal Protective Technologies Lab 
(NPPTL), based in the Pittsburgh area, has identified a large number of 
respirators fraudulently marked with the NIOSH moniker and falsely 
claiming to be a NIOSH-certified product.\3\ The vast majority of these 
are from China. However, there are also several manufacturers based in 
China with NIOSH-approved N95 respirators.


 Finally, we note that ISEA member companies have stepped in to 
combat the issue of nonperforming, or fake, PPE. Free testing provided 
by ISEA member companies is available to PPE users when they suspect 
the PPE they have sourced is nonperforming or substandard. In one case, 
an ISEA member found non-NIOSH certified respirator (KN95) masks to 
range from 45 percent-30 percent in efficiency. This catastrophically 
inadequate product was marked as FDA approved, making it fake and 
illegal. When ISEA member Magid Glove and Safety tested 10 foreign 
respirators, eight failed and two passed. The PPE manufacturer and 
distributor based out of Romeoville, IL, cited one example in which the 
fake respirator was no different that wearing a bandana on the face.
            

 ISEA asks Congress for legislation mandating that online sellers 
audit their sites for fake, fraudulent and counterfeit PPE and other 
products, and remove them. ISEA joins with NAM in calling for 
legislation to hold online retailers partially responsible 
(contributory liability) for any injuries arising from the use of fake, 
fraudulently marked or counterfeited products sold on their platforms.

    COVID-19 has led to increased cybercrime and misinformation, 
preying upon consumers looking to keep themselves and their families 
safe. These criminals require domain names, which can also include 
phishing and malware campaigns, selling dangerous counterfeits and 
setting up scam sites.\5\ The value of WHOIS data (domain name 
registrations) is widely known throughout the cybersecurity community. 
But law enforcement and IP holders have effectively been blocked from 
accessing this critical data. But access to this data serves the public 
interest and contributes to the security of the Internet by providing 
contact information to support efforts related to consumer protection, 
cybercrime investigation, domain name system (DNS) abuse mitigation, 
intellectual property protection, and for appropriate law enforcement 
needs. ISEA believes legislation is also needed to allow Federal law 
enforcement authorities and IP holders to identify the individuals 
behind the websites and electronic front companies offering non-
legitimate products.

  Questions Submitted by Hon. John Thune
    Question. In your written testimony you mention how sellers of 
counterfeit products have leveraged online platforms like Amazon to 
gain access to unsuspecting consumers. I recently introduced the 
bipartisan Platform Accountability and Consumer Transparency Act, or 
PACT Act, which would help ensure that online platforms are liable if 
they do not remove content or stop activity that a court order found to 
be unlawful. Do you believe this could help incentivize action by tech 
companies to stop the sale of illegal PPE on their sites?

    Answer. The PACT Act's provisions to: (1) require technology 
platforms to have an individual, who can be reached to hear complaints 
about fake and fraudulent products being offered on the particular 
technology platform and (2) remove from the 1934 Communications Act's 
liability protections if quick action is not taken would seem to 
incentivize online platforms to take quick action on legitimate 
complaints and could provide incentive for platforms to take preemptive 
actions and consider the legitimacy of products before they are 
accepted on to the platform.


 Question. Like many states, Rhode Island has had chilling 
experiences procuring PPE, including unfulfilled orders, fraudulent 
sales, and a competitive race for supplies. This toxic atmosphere 
discourages not only buyers, but also suppliers, from entering the PPE 
market, as manufacturers face challenges understanding the market, 
product standards, and the allocation process. In your experience as 
buyers of PPE on behalf of hospitals and health-care providers, what 
does the current PPE market look like and how has it been tainted by 
the disorganized, toxic procurement process?

    Answer. While ISEA does not buy PPE for hospitals, the 
disorganized, toxic procurement process has two impacts on legitimate 
PPE manufacturers: (1) respirator, protective garment, and glove 
manufacturers have had to increase their awareness of their brands and 
company identity being ripped off; and (2) these PPE manufacturers have 
had to inform and educate end-users about how to be aware of fake 
websites.


On March 19, 2020, with coronavirus cases beginning to go skyward, 
the President said the following when asked about buying and 
distributing PPE: ``The Federal Government's not supposed to be out 
there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping . . . Governors 
are supposed to be doing it.''

    On March 29th, he accused nurses and doctors of stealing PPE: 
``Something is going on, and you ought to look into it as reporters. 
Where are the masks going? Are they going out the back door?''

    In mid-April, he called reports of PPE shortages ``fake news.''

    On May 6th, a nurse told reporters gathered in the Oval Office that 
the availability of PPE was ``sporadic.'' Trump responded, quote, 
``Sporadic for you, but not sporadic for a lot of other people. . . . I 
have heard we have a tremendous supply to almost all places.''

    Just last week, he said, ``My administration currently has zero 
unfilled requests for equipment or anything else that they need from 
the Governors . . . frankly we are stocked up and ready to go.''


Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Wyden:

On behalf of the National Association of Manufacturers, I write to 
thank you for holding today's hearing, ``Part 2: Protecting the 
Reliability of the U.S. Medical Supply Chain During the COVID-19 
Pandemic.'' The NAM is the nation's largest industrial trade 
association, representing small and large manufacturers in every 
industrial sector and in all 50 states. Manufacturers are concerned 
about the rise in fake and counterfeit products, which cost the U.S. 
economy nearly$131 billion and more than 325,000 jobs in 2019 alone.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new urgency to the fight against 
counterfeits. Fake goods not only reduce U.S. jobs and infringe on 
creators' intellectual property rights, but also threaten consumer 
health and safety. Counterfeit test kits and unsafe PPE peddled to 
unwitting consumers can exacerbate the public health crisis that our 
nation faces.


Counterfeiting is not a new problem; it has harmed manufacturers, 
American workers and consumers for years. But the problem is getting 
worse, and the COVID-19 pandemic has shown just how dangerous inaction 
can be. As part of the nation's critical response effort, manufacturers 
have been supplying health-care workers and other Americans on the 
front lines of this crisis with vital goods, including personal 
protective equipment, hospital beds, ventilators, hand sanitizers, 
cleaning supplies and other critical health-care and safety products. 
But while manufacturing men and women work long hours to ramp up 
production of desperately needed products to fight the spread of this 
deadly illness, counterfeiters have exploited the crisis to peddle fake 
tests, dangerous vaccines and ineffective protective gear. These 
counterfeits are harming American citizens and hindering manufacturers' 
efforts to protect their workers and communities.

The prevalence of counterfeits in the COVID-19 response has brought new 
urgency to this long-simmering issue. So the National Association of 
Manufacturers is leading the charge against fake and counterfeit goods, 
bringing together diverse stakeholders and driving innovative policy 
solutions to address these issues once and for all and to ensure the 
long-term success of our sector and the safety and security of the 
people who rely on our products.



The threats to individuals can be severe. Counterfeit products 
integrated into electronics such as chargers and hoverboards have 
caused fires and physical harm. Faulty components that make their way 
into critical auto safety products like airbags can undermine these 
lifesaving mechanisms. Items like helmets falsely claiming to meet 
government-approved safety standards have failed to perform their 
functions and resulted in deaths.\20\


The Internet and e-commerce platforms have provided counterfeiters with 
access to global markets through easily accessible sales and 
distribution channels. A factory in China can quickly create an online 
account with a platform and begin selling directly to consumers around 
the world. These same channels also allow counterfeiters to avoid 
liability for the harm caused by counterfeit goods and continue to 
pursue their illicit operation. Counterfeiters can use false identities 
and addresses and then vanish at the first sign of trouble.\25\


Congress should appropriate emergency funds to boost enforcement 
against fake and counterfeit versions of products urgently needed for 
COVID-19 treatment and care such as test kits, medicines, personal 
protective equipment and other health supplies:

       Those funds should be routed through the National Intellectual 
Property Rights Coordination Center to ensure interagency sharing of 
real-time intelligence and coordinated ramp-up of enforcement efforts. 
The FDA should play a key role in providing up-to-date information to 
both consumers and government agencies on products requiring FDA 
approval and the status of approvals to ensure appropriate border 
enforcement against counterfeit products.

       Congress should strengthen the ability of key government 
agencies to protect American consumers from fake medical products by 
ensuring the FDA has full and clear statutory authority to destroy 
counterfeit medical products.


Current U.S. law fails to appropriately hold e-commerce platforms 
accountable for their role in the rise of counterfeits, despite the 
evidence that fake goods have proliferated on the Internet. By allowing 
counterfeiters unparalleled access to consumers worldwide and the 
ability to vanish into cyberspace at the first sign of trouble, e-
commerce platforms offer counterfeiters the perfect avenue for selling 
fakes while avoiding liability.\31\ The immense revenue generated from 
third-party sales coupled with various gaps and safe harbors in U.S. 
laws have empowered e-commerce platforms to dispense with basic 
oversight responsibilities that would prevent counterfeits from being 
sold on them.


 \32\ Contributory trademark liability is a means by which an entity 
may be held liable for selling counterfeits even though they do not 
actually engage in infringing activities in certain instances, such as 
where ``it knows or has reason to know'' the product was fake. Inwood 
Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 847-850 
(1982); see also 35 U.S.C. Sec. 271(c).
    \33\ Tiffany Inc. v. eBay, Inc., 600 F.3d 93, 103 (2d Cir. 2010) 
(``Contributory trademark infringement is a judicially created doctrine 
that derives from the common law of torts.'').
    \34\ See Eric Goldman, eBay Mostly Beats Tiffany in the Second 
Circuit, but False Advertising Claims Remanded, Technology and 
Marketing Law Blog (April 1, 2010), https://blog.ericgoldman.org/
archives/2010/04/ebay_mostly_bea.htm (``In a subtle opinion with 
potentially significant implications, eBay has preserved most of its 
big 2008 district court victory in the long-running Tiffany v. eBay 
case. However, as seems to be the norm with federal appellate opinions, 
the opinion intentionally sidesteps some key open doctrinal questions 
squarely raised by the case--such as if the Second Circuit recognizes 
the nominative use defense, or the Second Circuit's standards for 
contributory trademark infringement. As a result, we don't get the 
clean and decisive doctrinal standards that help make a case truly 
precedent-setting . . .'').
Because e-commerce and its role in the proliferation of counterfeits 
are relatively new, whether and to what extent contributory trademark 
liability applies in this context is unclear. As such, courts often 
sidestep the issue or parties are likely to settle out of court.\35\ In 
other cases where courts do attempt to address the issue, laws that 
were not intended to protect e-commerce platforms from selling 
dangerous products are interpreted as providing them a legal safe 
harbor.\36\ Both Congress and the administration have explicitly 
highlighted the need to assess liability for e-commerce under both 
contributory trademark infringement and product liability law to combat 
counterfeits,\37\ steps that manufacturers generally support.\38\ Such

Meanwhile, we must not take our eyes off homeland security 
threats, like terrorism, cyber attacks, and disaster 
preparedness and response.


 I want to hear from Secretary Mayorkas about how the Department is 
responding. Meanwhile, we must not take our eyes off homeland security 
threats like terrorism, cyber attacks, and disaster preparedness and 
response.


In just the first few months of the 117th Congress, we have 
faced the on-going pandemic, a deadly winter storm in the 
South, an attack on the U.S. Capitol, fallout from cyber 
attacks that have had significant impacts on both individuals 
and corporations, and the burgeoning crisis along our Southern 
Border, not to mention threats from authoritarian nation-states 
like China and Russia that are only getting more emboldened in 
their malign activities.
    Just over a week ago, a cyber attack on Microsoft's 
Exchange email server is believed to have infected tens of 
thousands of entities across Government and industry alike. 
Much like the SolarWinds cyber campaign, we probably will not 
know the extent or the damage caused by this attack for a 
while.
    Mr. Chairman, I know that you and I are in lockstep on this 
issue, as is the Secretary. I truly believe that cybersecurity 
is the preeminent threat to our National and homeland security, 
and if we don't act swiftly and decisively, we will come to 
regret it.

Federal Government offices are vulnerable to cyber attacks, with 
the number of cyber incidents reported by Federal agencies increasing 
more than 1,300 percent between 2006 and 2015.
    In 2015, a hacker exploited access provided by a Government agency 
contractor to break into Government databases to gain access to 22 
million security clearance files from the Office of Personnel 
Management.
    In 2017, Federal agencies reported more than 35,000 cyber 
incidents, some of which targeted old operating systems that were no 
longer supported by a vendor.
    According to the National Security Agency, it has not responded to 
a zero-day attack on Government systems in the last 4 years, largely 
because hackers have found better success through basic attack methods.
	ccording to the National Security Agency, it has not responded to 
a zero-day attack on Government systems in the last 4 years, largely

    H.R. 3710 will provide much-needed structure around a Federal 
Government-wide effort to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities in 
Federal civilian agency networks.


 Another top priority for our Department is increasing the 
Nation's cybersecurity resilience and protecting our critical 
infrastructure, especially in light of the recent campaigns 
exploiting SolarWinds and Microsoft Exchange and the growing 
threat of ransomware.
    As a first step, I have directed grant funding that will 
provide an additional $25 million for State and local entities 
across the country to improve their cybersecurity, raising the 
total minimum amount they must devote together to this critical 
mission to $77 million.
    The Department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 
Agency, or CISA, remains laser-focused on protecting and 
providing assistance to Federal civilian agencies and working 
with the private sector to improve our defenses.
    Thank you very much to all of you for your leadership in 
recognizing the importance of this issue and for the $650 
million you recently appropriated for CISA to enhance our 
ability to protect the Nation against cyber attacks.


Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Katko, and distinguished Members 
of the committee, it is an honor to appear before you today as the 
Secretary of Homeland Security. It is a privilege to return to the 
Department and lead the more than 240,000 employees who dedicate 
themselves every day to the safety and security of our Nation.
    The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confronts grave 
challenges, both seen and unseen, on behalf of the American people. The 
challenges include a deadly pandemic that has thrown every part of 
American life off its axis. Cyber attacks that target the Federal 
Government, our Nation's critical infrastructure, companies, and 
individuals alike. Terrorism, both foreign and domestic, that endangers 
our communities and our way of life. Extreme weather events and other 
impacts of the climate crisis that threaten lives and livelihoods. At 
the same time, we are rebuilding an immigration system that was 
systematically dismantled during the prior administration. We are 
making risk-based investments in our border management system to create 
safe, legal, and humane pathways to asylum and humanitarian protection.


strengthening cybersecurity and critical infrastructure
    The recent cyber attack campaigns exploiting SolarWinds and 
Microsoft highlight the significant cybersecurity challenges our Nation 
faces. Beyond cyber espionage, cyber attacks can paralyze companies and 
entire cities and are among the most serious security threats our 
country confronts.
    The Department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency 
(CISA) leads Federal efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks to the 
United States. Through the U.S. Coast Guard and TSA, DHS focuses on the 
cybersecurity of transportation, from aviation and rail to maritime and 
pipelines. The USSS and HSI combat 21st Century crimes, many of which 
are cyber-enabled. They play a pivotal role in identifying and 
apprehending the perpetrators of computer network breaches, ransomware 
attacks, and other cyber-enabled financial and cross-border crimes.
    In February, DHS announced initial steps to implement the Biden-
Harris administration's commitment to elevating cybersecurity across 
every level of government. The Department's immediate focus will be on 
securing Federal civilian networks, supporting SLTT governments to be 
more resilient, and protecting the Nation's critical functions. To do 
so effectively, DHS will further strengthen its partnerships with the 
private sector and invest in the infrastructure and people required to 
defend against malicious cyber attacks as part of a whole-of-Government 
effort.


stopping the threat of domestic violent extremism
    Terrorist threats to the United States have evolved and become more 
diverse since the attacks on September 11, 2001. Pernicious threats, 
both foreign and domestic, remain. Currently, the most significant 
terrorist threat facing our Nation comes from lone offenders and small 
groups of individuals who commit acts of violence that are motivated by 
a broad range of extreme racial, political, religious, anti-Government, 
societal, and personal ideological beliefs.
    Domestic violent extremism is typically fueled by false narratives, 
conspiracy theories, and extremist rhetoric usually spread through 
social media and other on-line platforms. The lethality of this threat 
is evidenced by the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, and 
other recent attacks across the United States, including against 
Government buildings and personnel and minority groups. Combatting this 
violence requires a whole-of-Government approach, which I have already 
initiated at DHS in collaboration with key partners, including DOJ, to 
help ensure the violence and assault on democracy that occurred on 
January 6 does not occur again.


 Continued support from the public is essential to identifying and 
reporting suspicious activity and threats of violence, especially on-
line. DHS is enhancing its public awareness campaigns and resilience to 
disinformation and other false narratives that inspire domestic 
extremist violence by updating its ``If You See Something, Say 
Something'' campaign and refreshing its Nation-wide Suspicious 
Activity Reporting Initiative to facilitate our partners' ability to 
identify, evaluate, and report tips related to terrorism, regardless of 
ideology. DHS is also working to support the efforts of technology 
companies and other private-sector partners to curb on-line recruitment 
and radicalization to violence.


 But I am concerned that we are losing real sight of the 
real threat that we face. Physical borders aren't the only 
thing that we have to be concerned with. We have seen in the 
last several months some of the most persuasive cyber incidents 
in our Nation's history.
    What is more, these incursions into our cyber space are at 
the behest of our greatest adversaries, particularly China.
    So, Mr. Secretary, I want to start off by asking you how 
you view cyber threats that we face as a Nation.
    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, I want to thank you for 
your focus and your leadership on this important mission set. 
As I mentioned before, I want to thank the committee for its 
support of our Department and the infusion of much-needed 
resources to CISA, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 
Agency.
    This is one of my foremost urgent priorities, for the very 
reason you articulate. The cyber threats that our country faces 
from nation-state actors, as well as individual actors, cannot 
be overstated. The threat to critical infrastructure cannot be 
overstated, and we have seen that in a number of exploitations 
in recent months and over the past several years.


",Addressing the Growing Threat of Cybersecurity Incidents,"The text highlights the increasing significance of cybersecurity threats to national security, emphasizing the urgency of addressing these challenges. It discusses various cyber incidents targeting government agencies, critical infrastructure, and private entities, including recent attacks on Microsoft's Exchange server and the SolarWinds cyber campaign. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) acknowledges the evolving nature of terrorist threats, particularly domestic violent extremism fueled by online disinformation and false narratives. Secretary Mayorkas underscores the importance of prioritizing cybersecurity efforts, strengthening partnerships with the private sector, and investing in infrastructure and personnel to defend against malicious cyber attacks. The DHS is committed to implementing measures to enhance public awareness, facilitate reporting of suspicious activities, and combat online recruitment and radicalization to violence."

Of course we cannot seriously talk about democratic decline 
around the world without confronting the stress tests on our 
own democracy. The assault on the U.S. Capitol on January 6th 
was the culmination of coordinated misinformation fueled by a 
systemic undermining from the very highest office in the land 
of the foundational elements of our democracy, including the 
right to vote, a free press, and our institutions themselves, 
tragically, the same pattern we are seeing in democratic free-
falling countries.


  Today, Beijing and Moscow are driving global authoritarian 
expansion to increasingly-sophisticated digital authoritarian 
surveillance and control tools and simple old-fashioned arrest 
of peaceful protesters in the shutting down of independent 
media. The United States must counter their malign efforts with 
a worldwide campaign to promote democratic values. We must also 
lead a serious attack on the lifeblood of these autocrats, the 
kleptocratic ways in which they loot public coffers to sustain 
themselves and erode freedom globally. We must maintain 
consistent and continuous pressure on authoritarian governments 
to stop them from abusing the rights of their citizens and 
exporting disinformation and other tools of repression abroad.


  Of course, we cannot talk about democratic decline around the world 
without confronting the stress tests on our democracy. The assault on 
the U.S. Capitol on January 6 was the culmination of coordinated 
misinformation . . . fueled by a systematic undermining--from the very 
highest office in this land--of the very foundational elements of 
democracy in this country including the right to vote, a free press, 
and our institutions themselves.


 China and Russia have become increasingly aligned, even 
though they have not established a formal alliance. As Steve 
Hadley and I wrote in the Atlantic Council's Insights Memo, 
Russian and Chinese leaders share an authoritarian, ideological 
orientation, and perceive American power and democratic values 
as a threat. They are working together more closely to 
undermine American influence and discredit our political 
economic and social system. In Latin America, Africa, Europe, 
and the Middle East, China and Russia have used proxies, 
economic instruments, disinformation campaigns, election 
interference, corrupt relationships, energy resources, and soft 
power to subvert both fragile and well-established democratic 
governments, and, thus, to foment instability. They have 
engaged Iran, Venezuela, and Cuba in these anti-American 
efforts.
    Venezuela is a flashpoint for Chinese and Russian 
investment and malign influence. Both nations have invested 
billions into Venezuela, taking advantage of its economic and 
political weakness, its vast petroleum resources, and their 
close relationships with a corrupt Maduro regime. Russian arms 
manufacturers sold $4 billion worth of weapons to Venezuela 
over the last 10 years, and China has invested some $67 billion 
in Venezuela since 2007. These instruments have propped up an 
illegitimate government and have undermined prospects for 
democracy, but it does not stop there.
    Russian disinformation and election interference campaigns 
have targeted Columbia. In late 2019, Colombian Vice President 
Marta Lucia Ramirez accused Russia and its allies in Venezuela 
of fomenting protests through social media campaigns. A few 
months later, New York Times journalist, Lara Jakes, reported 
on a State Department assessment that described Russian-linked 
social media accounts as conducting an influence campaign. That 
campaign has been under way not only in Colombia, but elsewhere 
in South America. By undermining democracies in the region, 
Russia and China seek to create instability in our backyard.
	 Russia and China have expanded investments in Africa as 
well. In 2003, annual Chinese direct investment in Africa was 
just $75 million, but by 2009, it reached $2.7 billion. Through 
its One Belt One Road Initiative, China is offering fragile 
democracies in Africa new rail lines, highways, and other 
infrastructure projects. African nations are finding that these 
projects have left them with massive debt and a lack of 
control. Russia is also increasing its investments in Africa, 
too, especially its military presence. It is striving to create 
a Red Sea Naval Logistics Facility in Sudan.
    Russia and China are waging a fierce battle against 
democracy through disinformation campaigns, cyber intrusions, 
investments, and attacks on Western values. China's substantial 
economic, financial, and technological leverage also constrains 
how countries can respond to this, whether in Europe, the 
Middle East, or elsewhere. So defining democracy and promoting 
democracy and human rights--defending and promoting democracy 
and human rights abroad is not only a moral imperative, but 
also a sound strategic approach.


In Latin America, Africa, Europe and the Middle East, China and 
Russia have used proxies, economic instruments, disinformation 
campaigns, election interference, corrupt relationships, energy 
resources, and soft power to subvert both fragile and well-established 
democratic governments and thus to foment instability. They have 
engaged Iran, Venezuela and Cuba in these anti-American efforts.
    Venezuela is a flashpoint for Chinese and Russian investment and 
malign influence. Both nations have invested billions into Venezuela 
taking advantage of its economic and political weakness, its vast 
petroleum resources, and their close relationships with the corrupt 
Maduro regime. Russia's state oil firm, Rosneft, imported 503,000 
barrels per day of oil in 2019, 62 percent of Venezuela's total oil 
exports that year. Russian arms manufacturers sold $4 billion worth of 
weapons to Venezuela over the last 10 years. And China has invested $67 
billion in Venezuela since 2007. These investments have propped up an 
illegitimate government and have undermined prospects for democracy. 
Iran and Venezuela have cooperated to bypass damaging U.S. sanctions on 
both their countries. Iran has also sent ships to Venezuela loaded with 
gasoline and petroleum refining equipment, technical experts and 
supplies.
    But it doesn't stop there. Russian disinformation and election 
interference campaigns have targeted Colombia. In late 2019, Colombian 
Vice President Marta Lucia Ramirez accused Russia and its allies in 
Venezuela of fomenting protests through social media campaigns. A few 
months later, New York Times journalist Lara Jakes reported on a State 
Department assessment that described Russian-linked social media 
accounts as conducting ``an influence campaign.'' The campaign had been 
underway not only in Colombia, but elsewhere in South America, 
including Chile, Bolivia and Ecuador. By undermining democracies in the 
region, Russia and China seek to create instability in our backyard.


China and Russia are waging a fierce battle against democracy 
through disinformation campaigns, cyber intrusions, investment, and 
attacks on Western values. China's substantial economic, financial and 
technological leverage constrains how many countries can respond to 
this, in Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere.
    Defending and promoting democracy and human rights abroad is not 
only a moral imperative but also a sound strategic approach. What are 
the most effective means of achieving this core objective? There are 
several:

   a strong military and economic foundation at home,

   working closely with our allies and other nations to advance 
        a coherent, compelling moral narrative about democracy and 
        Western values,

   overcoming others' complacency to secure their support in 
        challenging the falsehoods put forth by Moscow and Beijing,

   countering influence operations in social media and exposing 
        them for what they are,

   providing fragile democracies with humanitarian assistance 
        through USAID as well as democracy support through institutions 
        such as NED, IRI, NDI, the Development Finance Corporation, and 
        Eximbank,

   imposing targeted sanctions against specific activities 
        (such as Russia's energy investments in Venezuela), and

   sanctioning government officials or others responsible for 
        corruption and human rights violations through the Global 
        Magnitsky Act of 2016, including asset freezes, travel bans and 
        exclusion from financial services.


 And so I do think that one of the things that is going to 
have to happen, and from my sense, is that as I read some of 
the Biden material, they are aware of the kind of undermining 
that is being done through cyber and misinformation in the way 
that technology is being used, and the Chinese and the others 
are doing it. And so I think that having this kind of a hearing 
and having really the sense that we have, one, not paid enough 
attention, we have been AWOL, two, that, in fact, we have not 
used our ``public diplomacy tools'' well enough in order to 
counter a lot of what is going on, and really then have more 
defensive ways of dealing with the cyberattacks and things that 
have been going on, and understanding that there are an awful 
lot of holes in the way that we are responding to this new 
threat.


gets because I do think they make a difference.
    I also think that we have not done enough recently to 
really look at how information can be exchanged--not 
propaganda, but information--and that the various instruments 
that are part of that have been either underfunded or have been 
malignly used in different ways. And we are dealing with a very 
different kind of system, as I mentioned earlier, that the 
Russians are able to use from their Communist Party experience. 
And I do think that what we have to figure out is how to put 
our money in a way where it really does make a difference, and 
the aid programs, and you mentioned the MCC and a number of 
ways. And you have been instrumental in helping the Institute 
of Peace--by the way, Paula and I were on this together--about 
how to deal with fragile states because they then become petri 
dishes for those who hate us and are very dangerous. And I 
think we need to keep examining how to do that.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Madam Secretary. If I might, just 
a closing point that Senator Cornyn and I have a bipartisan 
bill about strengthening civics education within the United 
States. In recent surveys, there are as many young Americans 
who support and believe in socialism as believe in capitalism. 
There are profound doubts about democracy, particularly after 
the events of January 6th and the disinformation about the 
value and legitimacy of free and open societies that we have 
lived through. It is my hope that on a bipartisan basis, we can 
move to a renewed investment in civics education to strengthen 
our own democracies you have both spoken to.


 Ambassador Dobriansky. All right. Thank you. Senator, I 
think you raise important points. Consistency, I think we have 
established, is a challenge. It is a challenge for all the 
obvious reasons. But let me--let me add here, China is 
definitively waging a disinformation campaign. There are cyber 
intrusions, as we know, and also with their substantial 
economic, financial, and technological leverage, one of the 
biggest challenges is that other countries that engage 
massively in trade and finance with China are also constrained. 
They are very constrained in their actions. So it is not only 
the issue of our trying to engage, combat others, counter 
influence operations and social media, and expose them for what 
they are, but also there is the challenge of the fact that many 
countries are engaged by the nature of their relationships, and 
then they are not willing to actually step forward and join us 
in this battle. So that is something that I think is even, if I 
could say, not only the issue of consistency, but we have a 
real challenge here to look at, whatever continent it is.


The authoritarian leaders know that information is power and if 
people are informed, they will not accept the awful conditions to which 
they are subjected to live. Hence, by restricting press freedoms, the 
African dictators act to keep our people in the dark--to keep them 
ignorant of their misery. While social media has allowed activists in 
some cases to evade surveillance, authoritarian leaders have learned 
how to create disruptions through propaganda, disinformation and 
shutdown of the internet among others. Recently, China and Russia, 
working in concert with many African dictators have made this situation 
worst.
    Yet, access to information is the bedrock of democratic 
institutions. While the U.S. invests heavily in access to information 
around the world, including in South Sudan, it is time to bolster these 
efforts. Those who impede the work of journalist must be held 
accountable and U.S. must increase its investment in free media. 
Moreover, the U.S. will also need to apply its superior technology and 
innovation to counter Chinese and Russian disinformation efforts.



Senator Coons. Thank you very much, Peter, and it is, I 
think, our intention in this committee and elsewhere to re-
engage and re-engage actively in the Horn of Africa as well as 
throughout the rest of the world. If I might ask one more 
question, Mr. Chairman, just of Wai Hnin and Nathan. Thank you 
both for your courage. And I understand that, despite social 
media restrictions, internet blackouts, a critical means of 
organizing in the face of a coup and a crackdown has been 
access to social media. If you could each speak to the 
importance of a free and open internet and social media to 
democracy and to activism in Hong Kong and in Burma, I would 
welcome that. Here in the United States, we have a very 
polarized social media landscape that has led to some 
disinformation campaigns, and in our Congress, we will be 
debating how best to balance protecting free speech online and 
regulations to prevent disinformation. So if you could in turn, 
Wai Hnin and Nathan, just briefly speak to that question. Thank 
you.
    Ms. Pwint Thon. For social media, it is very good for us 
because compared to 2007 and in the past uprising, we have seen 
the live footages of people on the street protesting. And now 
they are shutting down internet from 1:00 a.m. until 6:30 a.m. 
now, so we are worried what will happen because the military is 
doing nightly raids and people cannot report it on social media 
about the human rights violations happening on the ground.
    So we are very grateful that we have live information 
coming up from the country, and also it give more evidence to 
the international community that they need to act now, but of 
course the military is also using their social media platform 
to spread false information as well. But on a greater level, we 
appreciate having the internet, and we need that nightly 
internet cut to be stopped so that, you know, human rights 
violations can stop happening during the night as well. Thank 
you.
	 Mr. Law. Thank you for the question, Senator. First of all, 
Hong Kong people can still have access to Facebook and Twitter, 
these social media platform. But when they speak about the 
situation of Hong Kong or urging the international community to 
hold China accountable, they could be seen as breaching the 
National Security Law. So it really adds up and spread wide 
terror for them, making them afraid of expressing a genuine 
opinion online. Furthermore, China has been deploying its 
misinformation overseas, and also a lot of information warfare 
are conducting. So I have always been urging countries working 
with social media companies to really monitor and curb this 
misinformation campaign led by state actors, and to really 
safeguard democracy by stopping this infiltration to our system 
and uphold the values of democratic society.",Defending Democracy Against Authoritarian Threats: Strategies and Challenges,"The text addresses the challenges posed by authoritarian regimes, particularly China and Russia, to democratic values and institutions globally. It emphasizes the importance of countering disinformation campaigns, cyber intrusions, and malign influence efforts conducted by these regimes. Examples from Latin America, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East illustrate how China and Russia use proxies, economic instruments, and soft power to subvert democracies and foster instability. The importance of promoting access to information, defending press freedoms, and supporting free and open internet access is highlighted, particularly in regions like Hong Kong and Burma, where social media plays a crucial role in organizing and activism amidst government crackdowns. The text underscores the need for a coordinated international effort to defend democracy, including strengthening alliances, countering misinformation, imposing targeted sanctions, and investing in civic education and media freedom."

  Mr. Harrison. Well, I can begin there.
    I think that the impact is up to us. It is how we choose to 
implement a reduction in the defense budget will determine how 
much we are impacted in these critical areas that I believe are 
essential for the future force.
    I think that we should prioritize our investments in 
cybersecurity, cyber attack capabilities as well, and in space 
security and being able to better defend our space systems from 
attack.
    So a reduction in the defense budget does not mean that we 
have to reduce these areas.


 Micro grids and resilient transmission infrastructures. The 
Department of Defense needs to be able to carry out its 
critical military missions on key installations, despite the 
growing threats of cyber-attack; severe weather, such as ice 
storms, wildfires, hurricanes, floods; or even deliberate 
terrorist attack. That is why military bases practice, quote, 
``Black Start'' exercises to recover from a power outage and 
maintain operations for extended periods, even if the grid is 
down.


Mr. Carter. And with all the climate change issues we have 
got in the Arctic and with the shipping that is now going into 
the Arctic, the rescue mission of one icebreaker that can be 
effective in heavy ice and should there be a disaster from what 
we now calling the Northwest Passage, it could be a real Earth-
shaking disaster if it was some kind of cruise ship full of 
people that got in big trouble. To reach them without an 
icebreaker could be a real disaster, in addition to the climate 
issues that are up there and the jurisdiction issues. I want to 
keep emphasizing everybody has got to be thinking about 
icebreakers. We need them.
    Now back to my question and I still got a little time left. 
The Biden administration has set national security objectives. 
In those, their last security guidance, they mention near-peer 
competition by non-state actors, infectious disease, cyber 
attacks, and disinformation campaigns.
    Where would you put a climate change initiative, which 
General Austin and the Secretary have put forward, where would 
you put that in the ranking of what the administration has 
given? It is not concluded now, but it is one of those national 
security guidances that probably should be. Where do you think 
it should be put?
    Ms. Goodman. I think it should be there with the others, 
and I believe it is included in the President's interim 
National Security Strategy, perhaps not quite in that sentence 
but elsewhere in the direction, to address climate threats and 
it should be included because it affects all those others. 
Changing climate, drought, and food insecurities are increasing 
the opportunities for extremists, violent extremists, across 
North Africa, the Middle East, and in South Asia. That brings 
our forces, your forces from Fort Hood and elsewhere are all 
called up to serve when our Nation is threatened.


 Cyber Attack Response

    Ms. Howe, my first question is for you. You mentioned in 
your testimony that our cybersecurity adversaries, they are 
fast, and they are creative, they are persistent, and they are 
unconstrained by law or regulation. Unlike us, right, when we 
compare governments to governments. The add deterrence in 
building resilience, what is the tipping point for the DOD 
should respond when our government and businesses are 
constantly attacked? And I am putting that out because you 
talked about a whole of government.
    Do we need to have a conversation in our democracy on how 
we respond as a whole of government on some of these attacks? 
And when is an attack on our economic system or our healthcare 
system or our public health--public service like water and 
electricity, should we be having those conversations on how to 
respond as a whole government?
    Ms. Howe. Congresswoman, Chairwoman, you are absolutely 
right, and this is a very important question. You highlight a 
critical issue, which is we have not developed the appropriate 
response deterrence policy, escalation policies with respect to 
cyber activity. And every time we come across another event 
that is where a nation state is behind it, we struggle with the 
question of what the appropriate response is. We need to 
develop those norms. We need to develop those policies. We 
can't do them in a vacuum. There needs to be, you know, a 
multilateral agreement with like-minded allies in terms of what 
that appropriate policy would look like.

 Third and finally, Citizens United said nothing about 
foreign corporations spending in political campaigns. Indeed, 
in 2012 the Supreme Court explicitly upheld such restrictions 
in Bluman v. Federal Election Commission. Obviously, there is a 
lot of misunderstanding and misinformation and even, dare I 
say, fake news circulated about the Supreme Court's Citizens 
United decision. But I expect at least part of today's 
discussion may help us correct those misinterpretations, and I 
look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses here today.


 But yesterday Mitt Romney, what was an historic day in 
Congress, showed me that at least one person, at least one 
person, because they swore their oath to God, it made a 
difference. So in honor of Mitt Romney and showing that one 
person truly does have concern about not giving false witness 
because they swore an oath to God, I am going to ask the 
witnesses to stand and be sworn in.


 Mr. Raskin. Give me a second to compose my interrogatory 
thought, Mr. Chairman.
    Given that we live in an age of propaganda and fake news 
and disinformation, I am wondering, for any of the majority 
witnesses--forgive me, Mr. Smith--to what extent Citizens 
United figures into the spending of money to confuse the public 
and to add to the propaganda? Is there something about the way 
that money has been spent under Citizens United that 
contributes to the thick fog of propaganda that overhangs our 
politics today?
    Ms. Weintraub.
    Ms. Weintraub. I think anything that undermines disclosure 
makes it harder for us to find out who is behind what we are 
seeing online. I mean, people get all sorts of information 
online, and I don't think anybody wants to get their news from 
a Russian troll farm, but people didn't realize that is where 
they were getting the information from last time. So to the 
extent that Citizens United, as I have said, has undermined 
disclosure, I think it has also contributed to that problem.
    Mr. Raskin. Dr. Fiona Hill in her testimony described to us 
that Russia is the world's largest Super PAC today, that it 
basically operates like a Super PAC in terms of funneling money 
and propaganda into our politics, and other societies too.
	 Mr. Cohen. We will call that a question, and then we are 
going to let Mr. Weissman respond, if he wants to.
    Mr. Weissman. I am ready. I think two points come to mind. 
One, as Commissioner Weintraub said, there is an intersection 
between the general cultural impact of Citizens United and the 
rise of online advertising, particularly as it relates to lack 
of disclosure. So the system we have for disclosure is 
basically based on focusing on TV ads, and now we have moved to 
where TV ads are being competed with in importance for online 
advertising, huge amounts of money coming in. The disclosure 
system is really totally inadequate, and I think people are 
being confused by that.
    There is another component of this. I wouldn't want to call 
it propaganda necessarily, because there is a role for negative 
advertising and conflictual advertising in speech for sure. But 
what Citizens United has done--and Professor Smith's data I 
think are misleading but all correct. What it has done is lead 
to a rise, a significant rise in outside spending. Outside 
spenders are different than candidate spenders in a variety of 
ways.",Addressing Misunderstandings Surrounding Citizens United and Political Spending,"In a congressional discussion, concerns are raised about the impact of Citizens United on political spending and the spread of propaganda and misinformation. While Citizens United primarily focused on domestic corporate spending, the discussion touches on the broader issue of disclosure and the rise of online advertising. Witnesses emphasize the importance of transparency and the need to combat the influence of outside spenders, including foreign entities, in political campaigns."

 Today's threats can be cyber, or physical, or man-made, or 
natural. They can emerge from nation-states, criminal 
organizations, or terrorists. Just in the last 2 months we have 
dealt with cyber threats from Russia and Iran, ransomware 
attacks and disinformation campaigns on social media. These are 
the threats we know about. Many more may be lurking on the 
networks.


Today's threats can be cyber or physical, manmade or natural. They 
can emerge from nation-states, criminal organizations, and terrorists.
    Just in the last 2 months, we've dealt with cyber threats from 
Russia and Iran, ransomware attacks, and disinformation campaigns on

 Both CISA and S&T play critical roles in defending the homeland. 
CISA is charged with coordinating the Federal efforts to defend 
critical infrastructure against physical and cyber attacks and 
protecting the .gov. S&T is responsible for putting cutting-edge 
technologies into the hands of DHS's boots on the ground to enable the 
workforce to do their jobs better and safer.


 So I view this Solarium report as one of the critical 
things we can do in Congress this year, and I really believe 
that the next 9/11 could absolutely, positively be, God forbid, 
a cyber attack that is cataclysmic. I am not sure we are ready 
for it. I think this report recognizes that, and it 
recognizes--and it makes a series of recommendations.


 Miss Rice. So I think one of the problems with the election 
interference is--putting aside what the intent is, putting 
aside what countries like Russia and China--what specific 
candidate they are trying to help, put that determination 
aside. When you look at just the overwhelming amount of 
disinformation that is out there, how do you address that 
issue?
    So if a specific campaign sees this just repeated 
disinformation--that, obviously, we will just assume is 
negative--against one particular person, what do you suggest a 
campaign--and whether it is a Republican or a Democratic 
campaign, because disinformation is at the heart of what is 
happening here, and it--you know, the attempt to sway the 
opinions of everyday Americans.
    So how would you suggest that people and campaigns handle 
that?
    Mr. Krebs. So, stepping back a little bit in the broader 
disinformation issue, and countering disinformation, we tend to 
view it as a supply and demand problem. On the supply side, you 
actually--you have these--or the influence operators, whether 
it is Russia, Iran, China, whomever it is, doesn't matter, 
pushing that information. Right?


But the more important aspect of this--so we are--this is a 
Whack-a-Mole game if we are always chasing the latest disinfo 
campaign. What we have got to do is focus also on the demand 
side. The demand side is the American people. So how do we 
create a more discerning public, a more informed, educated 
public on the things that are happening across the news and the 
media and the social media platforms they see?
    So that is what we have put a lot of effort into, and 
that--you know, I think probably the most known, well-known 
thing we have done there is the War on Pineapple, which was 
last year we launched a program that distilled down how 
disinformation operations work, how the Russians do it, but we 
did it not in a way that it is Russia, it is whether you like 
pineapple on your pizza or not. So it is a very kind of non-
confrontational issue, but it is educational. We got 
Secretaries of State, election directors involved, pitted on 
either side. Even the--I think the armed forces of Canada got 
involved in the whole thing, so we had a foreign influence 
operator in here, but it doesn't matter.


 We also have a line of effort focused on cybersecurity. So, 
as organizations move to telework, what are the cybersecurity 
considerations? Because the attack profile changes. You might 
be using more VPNs, so make sure you have got your Citrix and 
other VPNs patched, things like that.
    But also targeting and looking into the phishing campaigns 
that we have already seen the bad actors using as an incentive 
or enticement to get people to click on links.
    We are also looking at these continuity of the economy 
aspects, as I already talked about, those 4 elements of how a 
function may be degraded.
    Then, looking deeply at disinformation, as well, so working 
with our intelligence community partners of how is disinfo 
playing out across COVID, and this is important in the election 
space. Particularly, we had a call last week with about 600 
State and local election officials about, you know, what are 
the hygiene practices they can take, but also what are we 
seeing in the disinfo space, and how can we dispel any sort of 
coronavirus or COVID impacts on voter turnout, for instance.


",Addressing Cyber Threats and Disinformation in Homeland Security,"Today's threats to homeland security encompass cyber, physical, manmade, and natural risks, originating from nation-states, criminal organizations, and terrorists. Recent months have seen cyber threats from Russia and Iran, ransomware attacks, and disinformation campaigns on social media. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) play vital roles in defending critical infrastructure and equipping DHS personnel with advanced technologies. The Solarium report emphasizes the urgency of addressing cyber threats, recognizing the potential for a catastrophic cyber attack akin to a modern-day 9/11. Disinformation poses a significant challenge, and efforts to combat it include education campaigns to create a discerning public, cybersecurity measures for telework, and collaboration with intelligence partners to address disinformation related to COVID-19 and elections."

And next, what role should the Department of State play in 
cultivating allies and partnerships versus the role of the 
Department of Defense? And are we striking the right balance? 
And what are the implications of getting that wrong?
    And then finally, General Hodges, as our cyber capabilities 
mature and cyber becomes increasingly important as a vast 
attack base, if you will, we will clearly need stronger cyber 
partnerships with European partners.
    Have European partners been willing to partner bilaterally 
with the U.S. on joint cyber operations? And which countries 
have the most interest in and could benefit most from U.S. 
mentorships in developing their capabilities?


  Mr. Langevin. And, General, if you could address the cyber 
question.
    General Hodges. Yes, sir. Thank you.
    First of all, five European allies stand out as being 
leaders in cyber development and they certainly do a lot of 
work: Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and the United 
Kingdom. Those are five good partners.
    Cyber protection of our critical transportation 
infrastructure is essential for U.S. efforts in Europe. The 
port of Bremerhaven, for example, if that is not protected from 
a cyber strike, then we cannot bring in a single vehicle or a 
single soldier.
    So I believe cyber protection of critical transportation 
infrastructure ought to count towards 2 percent. Lithuania and 
Latvia do that now. I think Germany knows how to do this as 
well.


 Sure, Special Operations Command in Europe, and also the 
NATO SOF [Special Operations Forces] headquarters in Mons, have 
both made significant impact on helping the front lines improve 
their--not only improve their own special forces, this is a 
very tight community throughout NATO and Eastern Europe inside 
the special forces.
    But also, more and more nations are recognizing the 
importance of resilience, the ability to resist disinformation 
as well as attacks. This is an area where our special forces 
have been particularly helpful in strengthening resilience of 
nations along NATO's eastern flank. I would say you can never 
have too much [inaudible] forces, small numbers with big 
impact.


  Secondly, the infrastructure. We depend so much on 
transportation infrastructure, airports and seaports, around 
the world to do what we do. If those are not protected from 
cyber strike, then it is the same thing as if somebody launched 
Iskander missiles at the port of Bremerhaven. So investing in 
cyber protection and working with allies there.


 Ms. Wormuth. The most important step to better coordinating with 
our allies in a more comprehensive manner would be to develop a 
comprehensive, whole of government strategy for competition with China 
and Russia; addressing gray zone challenges should be a subset of that 
larger effort. Working closely with allies and partners is an essential 
element of a comprehensive, proactive competitive strategy and while 
gray zone challenges are certainly an agenda item in many bilateral 
conversations there is a need for a more coordinated approach so that 
the United States and its allies can respond to provocations more 
quickly in the future. While our allies and partners may not agree with 
the United States on how to react to every specific provocation, 
aggressive actions by both China and Russia are raising concerns in 
both the Indo-Pacific and Europe, creating an opportunity for the 
United States to build coalitions to counter gray zone activity. In 
addition to developing a U.S. government-wide comprehensive competitive 
strategy, the Department of Defense can take some specific steps to 
support and enable the broader strategy. In particular, DOD should 
continue to reaffirm its commitment to allies and partners in Europe 
and Asia, and back these statements with increased activity in forums 
dealing with gray zone activity such as cyber-attacks and 
disinformation. DOD could increase its involvement with regional 
organizations like ASEAN and the European Union, and build on its 
already robust exercise program to include a focus on thwarting gray 
zone activity where appropriate. In most cases, existing defense 
partnership agreements and alliance agreements already provide a broad 
scope for DOD to deepen its focus on combating gray zone activity in 
concert with allies and partners. More than a need for new 
arrangements, the challenge for DOD is determining how to design 
multilateral responses with partners and allies who may have different 
risk tolerances than the United States when it comes addressing Russian 
and Chinese behavior. Frequent conversations with allies and partners 
about gray zone activity and how best to counter it in their regions 
before specific situations arise would better position DOD to gain 
allied and partner support quickly when confronted with a provocation.


 General Hodges. The key to success here is to look at this as part 
of Great Power Competition and that we have to compete in all domains . 
. . diplomacy, information, military, and economic (DIME) . . . it 
can't be just DOD . . . it will take most of the other departments of 
the U.S. Govt . . . and to recognize that neither the Kremlin or the 
Chinese Communist Party play by the same rules observed by the USA and 
our Western Allies. Instead they work thru the continuum of national 
power in all domains, and using illegal as well as legal means, to 
achieve their aims. This also means that we have to make a focused 
effort on building up societal resilience within the USA and within the 
societies of our Allies and Partners. Sweden and Norway are doing a 
particularly good job on this. This means taking steps to build/rebuild 
confidence in the pillars of our liberal democracy (electoral process, 
judicial process, media, governmental competence) in order to reduce 
our vulnerability to disinformation, hardening our vulnerable 
infrastructure from cyber-attacks, and reducing our reliance on foreign 
energy and critical materials and medicen. The U.S. Govt needs to work 
more closely with NATO, not as an afterthought or `additive' measure 
but as the start-point, if we want to have coordinated efforts with the 
leading nations of Europe, especially Germany, France, and UK. This 
will help us achieve a common view of the threat . . . often the 
hardest part since many European nations, especially in western and 
southern Europe, are reluctant to be so blunt in assessing the Kremlin 
or China.",Enhancing Allied Partnerships and Cyber Cooperation in Security Strategies,"The text discusses the critical role of both the Department of State and the Department of Defense in cultivating alliances and partnerships, particularly in the context of addressing security threats such as cyber attacks and disinformation campaigns. Officials emphasize the importance of coordinated efforts with European partners to bolster cyber capabilities and resilience against various threats.

The need for a comprehensive strategy, increased involvement in regional organizations, and proactive measures to strengthen societal resilience are emphasized as key elements in effectively addressing security challenges in the modern era."

                    (C) to widen the scope of Chinese authoritarian 
                influence around the world, including--
                            (i) to suppress political opposition to the

 According to this document, these delays are not just a 
dip. This document warns the Postmaster General of significant 
and widespread drops across the board, in first-class 
marketing, periodicals, and other categories. This document 
shows that these delays are not a myth or conspiracy theory, as 
some of my colleagues have argued. These steep declines did not 
start in April or May, when the corona crisis hit us, but in 
July when Mr. DeJoy came on board and began making his changes.


  We all agree that the Postal Service needs to be reformed 
to better serve the American people. We all want the Postal 
Service to be as efficient and effective as possible to ensure 
Americans receive their prescriptions on time, small businesses 
thrive, and mail-in ballots are delivered in a timely fashion.
    But meaningful reform is going to take bipartisanship, 
something we have seen very little of in the last few days. 
Democrats fabricated a baseless conspiracy theory about the 
Postal Service and hastily passed a bill Saturday before 
hearing from you, Mr. DeJoy. The bill had no prior committee 
action to vet the bill, no hearings, no markup.


 Is the Postal Service telling states they won't be able to 
deliver ballots on time? No. What the Postal Service is doing 
and has for years is trying to warn states their vote-by-mail 
laws don't take into account what the Postal Service can and 
cannot do. USPS can treat ballots as first-class mail or better 
than first-class mail, but they cannot break the laws of time 
and space.
    The letters that Democrats characterize as threats and 
propaganda are good-faith efforts to prevent weeks of 
uncertainty and confusion, such as what happened very recently 
with Chairwoman Maloney's race.


  So, with that, I do look forward to this hearing going 
forward. I fully anticipate a lot of political theater from my 
friends on the opposite side of the aisle. I do anticipate the 
continued attempt to portray a conspiracy that does not exist 
when, in fact, it is their own party that I believe are fully 
committed, based upon the HEROES Act and other comments, to 
influence this upcoming election using fraudulent methods.


 Today, Mr. DeJoy will be viciously attacked with 
prepackaged questioned and false accusations, one member even 
suggesting impeachment. That's original. How sad is it when the 
cancel culture has reached the Halls of Congress? The man 
sitting before this committee today is not who the Democrats 
have villainized him to be. He's here today because he 
supported President Trump, and with this Congress, that makes 
you a target.


 As part of this conversation, there are many inaccuracies 
about my actions that I wish to again correct. First, I did not 
direct the removal of blue collection boxes or the removal of 
mail processing equipment. Second, I did not direct the cutback 
on hours at any of our post offices. Finally, I did not direct 
the elimination or any cutback in overtime.
    I did, however, suspend these practices to remove any 
misperceptions about our commitment to delivering the Nation's 
election mail. Any further assertions by the media or elected 
officials is furthering a false narrative to the American 
people.


 Mr. DeJoy. Thank you, ma'am. Since I've been here, we've 
spent $700 million in overtime. The overtime rate before my 
arrival was at 13 percent within the organization. It's still 
at 13 percent. As I said in my opening statement, this is a 
continued misinformation regarding what I did since I've gotten 
there. I never put a limitation on overtime.


   Mr. Gosar. OK. Mr. DeJoy, thanks very much for coming 
today. I want to clear up some obvious political disinformation 
that the majority is actually putting out, so--and then I also 
want to say thank you very much for acknowledgment of the dip 
in services, but we'll get to that in a few minutes.
    On Saturday on the House floor, my colleagues said the Post 
Office is on the verge of collapse. But that's not true. You 
have over $10 billion cash on hand and access to a $10 billion 
line of credit, which makes you fiscally viable through August 
2021. Is that true, Mr. DeJoy?
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes. But I would say that only in Washington, 
DC. would that be a good position to be in, when I have $135 
billion in liabilities, a $2.5 billion a month--a week--
biweekly payroll and a whole bunch of others. But, yes, we can 
get through the election and with the loan, should we take it. 
I don't know how we would pay it back, but should we take it, 
we should be fine for--through mid 2021.


Chairwoman Maloney.--and the question is, will you put the 
machines back?
    Mr. DeJoy. The answer is no. Every accusation you made, 
other than the truck--adhere to the truck schedule, is 
inaccurate and more misinformation for the American public.


So, here we go again. Seems like just yesterday we were 
hearing how the Trump campaign colluded and conspired with 
Russia to interfere with the last election. And when the facts 
actually came out, there was no evidence that that ever 
occurred. This is absolutely a concocted narrative by the 
Democrats to stoke fear in the American people, just like the 
Russia collusion hoax.


 Mr. DeJoy, I just want to apologize to you. You're getting 
a berating up here. Congressman Lynch going into a five-minute 
dialog would not give you time to answer your questions, would 
not--was yelling over you. It's typical of how this hearing has 
gone.
    And what's amazing to me is this bill had to be rushed out 
this past Saturday. You remember--do you know that 67 members 
did not even take the time to show up? If your workers at the 
post office don't show up, what happens? They don't get a 
paycheck and the mail doesn't get delivery.
    It's an insult what the Democrats are trying to do, a false 
narrative that has not worked for them since this President was 
elected. The Mueller report, the impeachment, none of it is 
working. Now they're going fishing for this. I apologize to 
you.


 Mr. Jordan. You've got an amazing record in business. 
You've got an amazing history of community service. You help 
kids with their education. You served your community, served 
our country, and these people are out to get you. When all the 
facts--none of the facts--as The Wall Street Journal said this 
is one giant conspiracy from the Democrats.
    I just want to know, what could be their reason? What could 
it be, Mr. DeJoy? We know it's not based on the facts. What 
could it be? Might it be politics? Might it be? Might it be the 
election coming up? Might it be the fact that they actually 
want to wait and count votes after election day?


 Mr. Duncan. Let me respond. There are lots of false 
premises in this about making the cut. The process was that we 
had lots of people who put input, including Members of 
Congress, members of the administration, all of our Board 
members. I think I put in a half a dozen different names.
    We ran into a period of time after the holidays and when 
the COVID started that we weren't moving as fast as possible. 
We got together. We talked about, well, we need to make sure 
that we have as many candidates as possible because you get a 
better pool, you get a better choice at the end of that time.


 I've got diabetic constituents who are waiting for insulin. 
I've got constituents with cancer waiting for chemo drugs to 
come in. But this headline really took the cake for me: ``Rats 
reported feeding on packages of rotted fruit and meat as 
Postmaster General's cutbacks unleash chaos at California's 
mail centers.'' This is from not some haven of liberal fake 
news, Business Insider Magazine.


 So, this was in 2012. This was an election year, and this 
was while Obama was President and Biden was Vice President. I 
want to read a quote from Chief Operating Officer Megan Brennan 
at the time: ""The decision to consolidate mail processing 
facilities recognizes the urgent need to reduce the size of the 
national mail processing network to eliminate costly, 
underutilized infrastructure. Consolidating operations is 
necessary if the Postal Service is to remain viable to provide 
mail service to the Nation.""
    Now, the Democrats have cooked up this conspiracy theory 
that the post office is now somehow going to be at fault for 
disenfranchising voters or suppressing votes because--and the 
media is complicit in this. They've shown video of mail sorting 
equipment being moved out of facilities. Well, here I've just 
mentioned 10 facilities in Kentucky that were shut down in an 
election year.
    So, I want to ask Chairman Mike Duncan: Mr. Duncan, do you 
believe this in 2012 was part of some conspiracy to 
disenfranchise voters in the 2012 election or part of some 
conspiracy to keep people from getting their medication or 
Social Security checks?
    Mr. Duncan. Congressman, I have no knowledge of the 
conspiracy to keep people from voting or getting their Social 
Security checks. But, as a resident of that area, I know that 
it's added to the number of days it takes to send or receive a 
letter.
	 Mr. Massie. Right. And I believe you know Chief Operating 
Officer Megan Brennan. She was the COO in 2010 and then became 
Postmaster General. Do you question her motives in the course 
of these operations?
    Mr. Duncan. No. I worked very closely with Megan Brennan 
when she was chief of this organization, and she has great 
integrity. She knows the system. She's been an operations 
person. She was a letter carrier. She worked her way up. She 
bleeds post office blue.
    Mr. Massie. And she has a business degree from MIT, I would 
add.
    So, this wasn't a part of any kind of conspiracy then. It 
was a part of realigning the infrastructure of the post office 
to the changing needs of the U.S. customer.


 Mr. Comer. Now, the Democrats want to portray you as 
implementing new policies because of the false narrative that 
the President wants to somehow sabotage the election. Is that 
narrative true?
    Mr. DeJoy. I am not engaged in sabotaging the election.
    Mr. Comer. Absolutely false. As a matter of fact, aren't 
you planning on voting by mail? Did someone tell me that?
    Mr. DeJoy. I am, yes.
    Mr. Comer. So, you have full confidence that when your 
ballot is in the mail, it will get to the appropriate election 
official on time, obviously, correct?
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Comer. Will you pledge here today that the Postal 
Service will do its best to return all ballots this election on 
time?
    Mr. DeJoy. I do, sir.
    Mr. Comer. What would you tell Americans who are concerned 
about something happening to their ballot once they put it in 
the mail this election season? What would you tell the 
Americans? Because they've seen a lot of that from my 
colleagues on the Democrat side. This has been their spin since 
the Russian hoax fell flat, since the impeachment sham died in 
the Senate. Every conspiracy theory today that the Democrats 
have used to try to hurt the President has fallen flat. So, 
this is the new flavor of the day.


 Mr. Mfume. Could you supply to this committee the density 
studies for the last three months, because there's been an 
accelerated removal of boxes, and accelerated removal of 
sorting machines, 671 to which you said earlier you would not 
put back online.
    I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I don't believe that 
Humpty Dumpty fell. I think he was pushed. And when I see these 
sort of things back up in such a way that we get your report 
dated August 12 that says, Yes, there has been an eight percent 
decrease in mail arriving on time, a nine percent decrease in 
periodicals arriving on time, and a decrease in virtually all 
other classifications, it just makes some of us a little 
suspect. And I'm sure you would understand that.


 Mr. Comer. Let's allow the witness to answer the questions 
and the false accusations.
    Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Reclaiming my time, I did not 
interrupt any other member while they were talking, and I 
expect not to be interrupted. The time is mine.
    Mr. DeJoy, you are not being honest with the committee 
about removing the sorting machines. We have been asking you 
for details for weeks, and you have been hiding them from us 
while removing them at a break-neck pace.
    On August 4, your staff gave this committee a briefing on 
this issue, and all they told us was that you'd be moving 
machines around to where they were needed most. We have the 
slides from that briefing. There was no mention that taking any 
sorting machines offline.
    On August 11, your general counsel responded to our request 
for more information with no mention of taking any sorting 
machines offline.
    Your culture of misinformation has even trickled down to 
Florida postal leadership. On August 14, my office asked 
whether sorting machines were being removed at the Royal Palm 
facility, which covers all of south Florida, and were assured 
that capacity was actually being expanded.


 Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Madam Chair. That was quite a 
debacle. This is exactly--this hearing right here is exactly 
why America does not trust Congress. Our cities are on fire, 
violent mobs roam our streets at night, the Chinese have 
crushed the American economy with a virus, and Democrats are 
talking about a mailbox conspiracy.
    Postmaster General DeJoy, are you aware of any evidence 
whatsoever that supports a mail delivery conspiracy?
    Mr. DeJoy. No, sir.
    Mr. Higgins. Would you repeat that, sir?
    Mr. DeJoy. No, sir.
    Mr. Higgins. The question is an answer America needs to 
hear. Are you aware of any evidence whatsoever of some kind of 
a mailbox or mail delivery conspiracy?


Postmaster DeJoy and Chairman Duncan, my constituents in 
rural West Virginia rely on the Postal Service to receive their 
essential prescriptions, their mail, and their packages. Thank 
you for your continued work during the pandemic to ensure that 
these critical services continue.
    In a year that is riddled with conspiracy theories, such as 
baseless claims of Russian collusion, we are wasting another 
hearing opportunity to attack our duly elected President over 
the most blatant and verifiably false claim that Republicans 
are destroying the United States Postal Service.
    This couldn't be further than the truth. Everyone knows 
that the Postal Service needs a serious overhaul, but bailing 
out our Postal Service without instituting any necessary 
reforms is not the answer. Democrats here today are doing a 
great disservice to our postal workers and undermining American 
confidence in our electoral process.


 Mr. Green. Thank you, Chairwoman and Ranking Member.
    Today, Democrats are pushing the conspiracy theory that 
President Trump has put the Postal Service in great jeopardy. 
This is just more hysteria in a long line of Democrat hoaxes, 
including the Russia probe, the Mueller investigation. Remember 
Adam Schiff? He saw with his own eyes proof of Russian 
collusion. I guess he must have kept that from Mueller. Oh, who 
can forget the impeachment sham, by the way, attacking the 
President's loans, his business associates, of course, his tax 
returns. They have nothing to offer the American people but 
attacks on the man they despise, Donald Trump.
    The postal union should realize--and I know they've 
endorsed Joe Biden, but they should look at this. The Democrats 
are throwing the postal carriers under the bus just to get at 
Trump. It's despicable. If the Postmaster General's donations 
are a conflict to his doing a good job, wouldn't the postal 
union's millions in donations over the years to Democrats 
disqualify them from delivering the mail?
    Message to all postal workers, the Democrats are insulting 
your integrity. Weaponizing the House Oversight Committee to 
fuel Speaker Pelosi's postal conspiracy theory is an outrageous 
abuse of power. Don't be fooled by the partisan rhetoric.


 Let's not call the Congress back to fix the lost 
unemployment in a pandemic, but let's call the Congress back to 
vote to give the post office more money they don't emergently 
need before we even hold the investigative committee hearing, 
all to support a conspiracy theory that a bipartisanly selected 
Postmaster General is trying to steal an election.
    This is theatrics. It's a joke. What a way to end the 
Democrat majority's time leading the House, another conspiracy 
theory and attack on the President. Typical. Actually, it's 
saddening. Our postal workers are quite capable and they are 
ready for the 2020 election.


  I was actually avoiding following other colleagues who 
called on you to resign, but I do think now it's time for you 
to resign, not because you're necessarily--there's this grand 
political conspiracy, but just the incompetence that we've seen 
when it comes to the Postal Service. It's time for you either 
to step down and have somebody that can run it or the Board of 
Governors should fire you.


Our suspicion was that the majority had little more than 
conspiracy theories and baseless, frankly, irresponsible 
charges to make against you, and we've seen that. And our 
suspicion was that the Democrats have no interest in doing 
anything to address the real issues that affect the Postal 
Service. We heard that today. They provided the Postal Service 
$25 billion because, quote, ""it's a worthwhile institution."" I 
agree it's worthwhile, indeed vital, but it isn't sustainable 
unless we help implement reforms.


  This week has been the opposite of a partnership and I fear 
has done long-term damage to the Nation's trust in one of its 
most esteemed, important, and citizen-serving Federal entities. 
And I also fear the Democrats' conspiracy theories have risked 
Americans' faith in the elections in a way the Russians and 
Chinese could only dream of.",Postmaster General Testifies Amid Postal Service Controversy,"The document presents excerpts from a hearing involving Postmaster General DeJoy, where he addresses allegations and concerns regarding changes at the Postal Service. DeJoy refutes claims of intentional delays or sabotage, emphasizing the need for reforms and bipartisan cooperation. Various lawmakers express skepticism about conspiracy theories and criticize the focus on political attacks rather than addressing genuine Postal Service challenges. The discussion touches on issues such as ballot delivery, mail processing equipment, and partisan narratives surrounding the Postal Service's role in elections. Despite differing opinions, there is a consensus on the importance of maintaining postal services while pursuing necessary reforms."

 a summary of beijing's policies in xinjiang
Background, Expertise and Methodology
    The author's relevant expertise and list of publications are shown 
on his institution's website at https://victimsofcommunism.org/leader/
adrian-zenz-phd/.
    The author's research methodology consists in the analysis of a 
wide range of documents. Most of these consist of publicly-accessible 
material obtained through government websites or the Chinese internet 
in general, such as: government reports, state media reports, 
government budgets, procurement and construction bids, recruitment 
notices, propaganda accounts that reflect the implementation and/or 
effect of relevant policies; as well as a cache of about 25,000 
internal (non-public) government documents obtained through local 
government social media networks (without hacking), that contain 
information such as spreadsheets of locals in ethnic minority regions 
by villages with their internment, education or labor status. On two 
occasions, the author was given internal leaked government documents 
from Xinjiang: the ``China Cables'' and the ``Karakax List.''
    The analysis of these sources proceeds from a basis of 
understanding key terms and their etymology (e.g. terms that identify 
different types of internment facilities), as well as the wider ethnic 
minority policy framework. Relevant sources are identified through 
extensive searches based on relevant terms (keywords) and whether they 
fit into the related policy framework. Sources are triangulated through 
comparison of different types of sources and comparisons with available 
relevant witness testimony. The analysis also includes state propaganda 
material, reading between the lines of propaganda statements to glean 
crucial additional evidence.
	 Generally, the approach is to: a) identify and establish the 
general overarching or wider regional policy framework; b) identify 
specific evidence for the local adaptation and implementation of this 
policy, in individual counties, townships, villages or relevant 
entities (such as factories, family planning entities or schools); c) 
identify related examples where statements made by affected individuals 
are included or cited in propaganda reports.


STATEMENT OF RUSHAN ABBAS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CAMPAIGN FOR 
                    UYGHURS, WASHINGTON, DC

    Ms. Abbas. Thank you so much, Senator Kaine, Senator 
Markey, and Senator Rubio, and the members of the committee for 
holding this hearing, and giving me a chance to testify here.
    Today's Chinese regime has been fed by the West and being 
empowered by the willful ignorance of the international 
community. Beijing is seeking global domination. The genocide 
Uyghurs are facing will be the future of the entire world if we 
do not move quickly, Orwellian surveillance, slavery, forced 
abortions, forced sterilizations, mass institutionalized rape, 
torture, concentration camps, crematoria. We know where this is 
leading. We swear, never again, many years ago, but we are not 
living up to that promise with the right sense of urgency.
    The CCP denying journalists' access to the region means 
that the Chinese regime has been able to control the narrative 
surrounding their genocidal crimes, especially within their own 
borders. This has led to a high number of genocide denialists 
who target survivors and the activists attempting to undermine 
their stories and even threatening their lives.
    I am joining you now from London, where I recently 
testified for the Independent Uyghur Tribunal. What I have 
heard in the past few days from the witnesses, experts, and 
even a perpetrator, himself, has informed that the situation is 
far worse than what we are hearing or speaking. Every word they 
spoke brought tears to my soul. This has been ongoing for 
years, and while we might pat ourselves on the back for making 
progress, Uyghurs back home are facing active genocide, and 
every day that goes by is another hell on earth.
    For myself, each night is a sleepless one, imagining what 
horrors my own sister might be facing. In September of 2018, my 
sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, a gentle, nonpolitical, law-abiding 
grandmother was taken by the CCP in retaliation for my advocacy 
and use of free speech here in United States as a U.S. citizen. 
She retired from her medical career early due to poor health.
    In 2 days, it will be her 59th birthday, and the third 
birthday that she has spent in a dungeon without her family. 
The Chinese regime has remained silent about her whereabouts. 
In fact, they published libel against me, and they said that my 
claims of her disappearance were false. They stated that I had 
stolen someone else's photo, and made up a missing relative. 
Chinese state actors use platforms which are forbidden to their 
own residents in order to discredit our advocacy work. In spite 
of this propaganda, it was confirmed in December of last year 
by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that she was 
sentenced harshly to prison on sham charges.
    Like so many Uyghurs, her supposed crimes are kept 
purposely vague. They use the false claims of terrorism and 
separatism to dehumanize and target any Uyghur. Her true crime 
was her ethnic identity, being a Uyghur. Of course, I am one of 
the millions who are suffering, but this situation illustrates 
how family members are being held hostage to punish American 
citizens for utilizing our rights here in a free country.

 Even after we lost contact with my sister and began advocating for 
her, we faced attacks and disinformation from the Chinese regime. The 
foreign ministry statements denied the truth. Chinese state media 
outlets, which are used as propaganda platforms, accused Uyghur 
activists, including me, who were looking to free their family members 
as liars and agitators. The Global Times spread the lie that I had made 
up my own sister and stolen her photo online in order to pretend we 
were related. Only a year later, the foreign ministry spokesperson Wang 
Wenbin admitted that the regime had sentenced my sister in a secret 
court to 20 years in prison under charges of ``being associated with 
terrorists.''


 Uyghurs are also facing an unprecedented wave of cyberthreats. 
Organizations are reporting higher than ever rates of hacking and 
phishing attempts, the majority of which originate from within China. 
Activists and survivors are regularly targeted on social media and have 
libel spread about them. We must demand an end to such abuse, which 
seeks to discourage survivors from sharing their story. The Chinese 
State believes that they operate with impunity in this regard, since 
their internet is largely contained. However, the international 
community is capable of action to address these growing attacks and 
disinformation.
    In the case of intimidation, both physical and in cyberspace, 
international bodies and nations which respect human rights must demand 
an end to these threats. The largest threat facing the world is a lack 
of transparency not only in China, but globally. The issue of 
addressing human rights atrocities is precluded by the ability to be 
made aware of them. The CCP understands this and takes every possible 
effort to prevent information about the genocide from flowing freely. 
The U.S. Embassy and consulates in China can be proactive in the 
effort, offering their services to help secure information about 
families who have faced retaliation. We can support the security of 
cyberspace for activists by stating firmly that any attacks against 
international activists is a condemnable offense on the international 
stage.


  policy recommendations
   The Uyghur American Community would benefit greatly from 
        increased government action in the process of locating and 
        confirming the safety of missing relatives. This would also 
        likely increase the number of activists willing to speak on the 
        genocide, should they feel protected. U.S. embassies and 
        consulates, as well as those of allied countries, could be 
        mobilized for better information-sharing and could request of 
        Chinese officials that they be allowed access to visit/seek out 
        missing individuals.

   The passage of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. This 
        bill is critical to making sure that Uyghur forced labor is not 
        profitable and forcing brands to extricate their supply chain 
        from the Uyghur region.

   The enforcement of import bans on goods associated with 
        forced labor, made possible through existing regulation and 
        guidance.

   The condemnation of cyber attacks and social media 
        harassment by Chinese state officials and operatives, which 
        serves to discourage participation in activism and stifles 
        international organizing.

   Place higher precedence on investigating CCP foreign 
        interference in threatening and stifling the free speech of 
        Uyghur-Americans.

   Prioritize Uyghur refugees through P2 status so that their 
        asylum and refugee applications are fast tracked.

   The undertaking of an urgent fact finding independent 
        investigation in East Turkistan to counter Chinese narratives 
        and propaganda that deny the testimony of survivors. The United 
        Nations must be granted access to the region in order to fully 
        assess the degree to which the genocide has progressed.


Dr. Zenz. I think one of the most pertinent cases for this 
is the fact that in a recent Chinese state media documentary, a 
number of well-known Uyghur intellectuals and textbook editors 
were paraded with shaven heads and prison clothing, having been 
sentenced to long prison terms over government-approved 
textbooks that were published several years ago, for supposedly 
promoting pan-Turkism and separatism and now are languishing in 
prison.
    The Chinese Government has embarked on a strong propaganda 
strategy to argue that the Uyghurs have always been Chinese. 
Pan-Turkism is the expression used for giving testimony to the 
Turkic heritage of the Uyghurs who are manifestly a Turkic 
people, with the Turkic language, and ethnicity, et cetera.


 Ms. Abbas. Each time when we have hearings like this, and 
they have the attention of our brave lawmakers who are 
defending the humanity, and they are trying to raise awareness 
and to do something, take some tangible action, that give hope 
for Uyghur people.
    I want to say that the Uyghurs in Diaspora should not 
forget that they are not alone. There are people like yourself, 
like the senators here, and the many people who are defending 
the conscience of the world, which is being a test with this 
current atrocity, current genocide. They are people being voice 
of these voiceless and defending those defenseless Uyghur 
people.
    So stay strong, have hope, and do not look at people like 
myself and my family as being retaliated because I spoke out. 
Do not stay silent, and take action and be the voice for your 
families if they are being taken. We are facing barrage of 
disinformation and attacks on our activists, and the witnesses 
too, and the survivors, by the Chinese regime.


 Ms. Abbas. We need to pass some legislation to deal with 
the threats against the Uyghur-Americans. Because as you 
mentioned, the Uyghurs are getting threatened by the Chinese 
regime, plus they are taking their family members and they are 
threatening them. So we should investigate the interference by 
the regime against the Uyghur-Americans. This includes the 
threats against the health and the wellbeing of their Uyghurs, 
as well as their families back home.
    There are many, of course, the videos of the Uyghur 
families are denouncing or disowning the Uyghurs in America, 
and that should be condemned and be countered with the truth. 
That Senator Kaine represents the largest Uyghur-American 
community in the U.S., and we really appreciate him 
highlighting the Uyghurs' case.
    That, actually, we believe keep the family members alive, 
just the highlighting, speaking. We need to investigate the 
presence of the CCP officials spreading propaganda on American 
campuses, or our free social media platforms, they are doing 
everything they can to dehumanizing the activists, and also 
spreading disinformation. So that should stop.",Testimony on Chinese Regime's Policies in Xinjiang and Impact on Uyghur Americans,"This testimony before a committee highlights the dire situation in Xinjiang, where Uyghurs face atrocities including surveillance, forced labor, sterilizations, rape, and concentration camps. Rushan Abbas, representing the Campaign for Uyghurs, describes personal experiences of family members detained by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) due to her advocacy. Dr. Zenz provides further insight into CCP propaganda and persecution of Uyghur intellectuals. Ms. Abbas calls for legislative action to protect Uyghur Americans and investigate CCP interference targeting activists and families. The testimony emphasizes the urgent need for global awareness and intervention to address the ongoing genocide and human rights abuses against the Uyghur people."

        is being communicated in violation of paragraphs (2) and (3) of 
        section 2004(b) of the Revised Statutes (52 U.S.C. 10101(b)),

        determines that State and local election officials have not 
        taken adequate steps to promptly communicate accurate 
        information to correct the materially false information, the 
        Attorney General shall, pursuant to the written procedures and 
        standards under subsection (b), communicate to the public, by 
        any means, including by means of written, electronic, or 
        telephonic communications, accurate information designed to 
        correct the materially false information.
            (2) Communication of corrective information.--Any

SEC. 1424. RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE OPERATIONS OF ELECTION ASSISTANCE 
              COMMISSION.

    (a) Assessment of Information Technology and Cybersecurity.--Not 
later than December 31, 2021, the Election Assistance Commission shall 
carry out an assessment of the security and effectiveness of the 
Commission's information technology systems, including the 
cybersecurity of such systems.
    (b) Improvements to Administrative Complaint Procedures.--
            (1) Review of procedures.--The Election Assistance 
        Commission shall carry out a review of the effectiveness and 
        efficiency of the State-based administrative complaint 
        procedures established and maintained under section 402 of the

 However, there are a few notable improvements in parts of 
the budget that deserve mention, including prioritized funding 
for the Indo-Pacific Strategy, countering Chinese, Russian, and 
Iranian malign influence, and a focus on strengthened 
engagement with the private sector. I hope you will address 
these topics as we go along this morning, as well as how you 
see the role of USAID in Afghanistan as we enter this new 
chapter of our engagement there. I am also interested to hear 
more about how USAID has and will respond to the coronavirus 
outbreak. As you know, we have been working hard on a 
supplemental appropriations bill to help in this regard, and I 
hope and trust we will pass that through the House this week.


 I think also the most obvious, additional resources to 
train healthcare workers to both the ability to test and 
diagnose for the coronavirus. I think additional resources to 
help health facilities. And I think, in some ways, most 
importantly, resources to help convey clear, accurate 
information to the public. What we have seen with various 
outbreaks over the years, and the coronavirus being the most 
challenging because it is global right now, covering obviously 
every continent but Antarctica, is combating some of the 
misinformation that is out there.
    We have seen some powers, such as Russia, quite frankly, 
put out lots of misinformation on the coronavirus in an effort 
to cause mischief. Whatever we can do to provide clear, 
accurate information on what it is and what it isn't, on the 
importance of coming forward, on making sure that people have 
trust in their healthcare facilities, I think that is a really 
important part of the long-term solution on this. So there are 
a number of ways in which we believe we are part of the long-
term answer.
    Mr. Rogers. We thank you for your testimony here today, and 
we wish you good luck.
    The Chairwoman. In conclusion, and I thank you for your 
last comment because it is a perfect segue to an issue which we 
haven't talked about this morning, and that is USAID Countering 
Malign Kremlin Influence framework. The Russian government, as 
you said, is pursuing efforts to undermine democracy, interfere 
with elections in the United States and in Europe, and fanning 
the flames of nationalism in Europe. Last year, USAID rolled 
out its Counter-Malign Kremlin Influence Development framework. 
I would be interested to know something about it because I know 
almost nothing. How has the framework impacted USAID 
programming in the region in results to date? How is USAID 
supporting regional programs in Europe, including in Central 
Europe, to address disinformation and rising nationalism? How 
much funding does USAID devote to civil society and other 
regional programs in Central Europe?


 Mr. Green. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have actually had a 
couple of trips to Europe recently. I was at the Munich 
Security Conference, and then prior to that took my first trip 
to the Balkans and was in North Macedonia, Albania Kosovo, and 
Bulgaria. And in each of those areas, we spoke a great deal 
about the Countering Malign Kremlin Influence framework. So 
what we are trying to do regionally and, in some cases, country 
by country, is develop economic independence so that they are 
less dependent upon, for example, Moscow, for energy sources. 
Also in some cases, like Ukraine, help strengthen their ability 
to protect against cyberattacks.
    In the region, a lot of our attention is now in bolstering 
transparency in government. One of the best ways that we can 
think of to counter these influences is to create transparency 
so citizens are aware of influences, and they are able to push 
back. I point to, for example, the U.S.-Albania Transparency 
Academy that we are preparing to launch. We hope it will be not 
only what the prime minister there is asking for in terms of a 
tool to fight corruption and malign influences, but perhaps 
even a model for the region.
    Another tool that we are working on that I think holds 
great promise, we often talk about the importance of creating 
independent, trustworthy media, and that is important. I think 
we need to go one step further because the other side isn't 
playing by the media rules that, you know, we believe in. I 
think it is also media literacy, and it is helping citizens to 
recognize disinformation, misinformation, malign influences in 
the media process. That is something we are attempting to 
strengthen and we will continue to build. So we have a lot of 
work to do, but we remain committed to countries like Ukraine 
and their stated goal to look more westward. And we will do 
everything we can to make sure that they have the tools and 
resources to pursue that.


 My other question is coronavirus related. I know that you 
have been named as a member of the President's coronavirus task 
force. I wanted to ask about comments. Last week, Lea 
Gabrielle, the coordinator of the Global Engagement Center, 
warned that Russia is coordinating millions of online false 
personas that seek to spread misinformation about the virus. 
What is the task force doing to combat this and to ensure that 
accurate information about this pandemic is the prevailing 
online narrative?
    I am concerned that the President's comments, which have 
gone against CDC guidance that coronavirus isn't really 
dangerous, that people with minimal symptoms should continue to 
go to work, that those comments would feed into this Russian 
propaganda threat.
   


",Addressing Key Priorities: USAID's Response to COVID-19 and Countering Malign Influence,"The discussion highlights key areas of focus for USAID, including combating misinformation around COVID-19 and countering malign influence from countries like Russia. Representatives express concerns about the spread of false information and the need for clear, accurate messaging to the public. USAID's efforts to support healthcare training, provide resources for health facilities, and disseminate accurate information are emphasized as crucial in combating misinformation. Additionally, USAID's Countering Malign Kremlin Influence framework is discussed, focusing on initiatives to bolster transparency, economic independence, and media literacy in regions affected by Russian influence. Questions raised about the President's coronavirus task force address concerns about misinformation and its potential impact on public health efforts."

 In this environment, there is little hope that Ethiopia's 
June 21 elections can credibly reflect the will of the people.
    I applaud the Administration's focus on this crisis. The 
appointment of Ambassador Feltman as Special Envoy to the Horn 
of Africa sent that important signal. Although we do need to 
have a broader conversation about Special Envoys in general, I 
appreciate this effort thus far.
    Prime Minister Abiy has met our diplomatic initiatives with 
stonewalling, broken promises, and unfilled commitments.
    The Government has failed to provide unfettered 
humanitarian access, secure the withdrawal of Eritrean troops, 
or commit to a political solution to the conflict, and 
throughout it has engaged in misrepresentation and 
disinformation, including on the origins of the crisis in 
Tigray, the human rights and humanitarian situation on the 
ground, and the active involvement of foreign troops in the 
conflict.


 Every day we learn of new details reflecting the true 
horror and violence occurring throughout Ethiopia. The 
Ethiopian Government has either dismissed such reports as false 
or provided assurances to our diplomats and officials that the 
situation is not as bad as it seems.


 scaling up the u.s. government response
    USAID's longtime and robust presence in Ethiopia implementing one 
of the largest and most complex portfolios in Africa has enabled a 
swift response to this crisis. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, USAID provided 
a total of $716 million in assistance to the people of Ethiopia across 
sectors like agriculture, education, global health, and women's 
empowerment. USAID funding also supports programming to protect human 
rights; promote accountability; counter disinformation, misinformation, 
and hate speech; mitigate conflict in Tigray and other at-risk areas; 
prevent gender-based violence, and promote inclusive governance and 
political processes. However, the crisis threatens the gains that 
Ethiopia has made across these sectors in the last 20 years.",Addressing Ethiopia's Humanitarian Crisis: U.S. Response and Concerns,"The U.S. government is deeply concerned about the escalating humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia, particularly in the Tigray region. Despite efforts to engage diplomatically, Prime Minister Abiy's government has not fulfilled commitments to facilitate humanitarian access or withdraw Eritrean troops. Reports of violence and atrocities persist, with the Ethiopian government downplaying their severity. USAID's substantial investment in Ethiopia aims to address these challenges, supporting a range of sectors like agriculture, education, health, and human rights. However, ongoing conflict threatens to undo decades of progress in these areas."

But nobody knows whether it's safe today or what is safe 
and how to make it safe under these conditions of chaos. This 
is a time when America leads the world in case counts. America 
leads the world in death count. 338,000 children have 
contracted the disease and been infected by it, and COVID-19 is 
spiraling out of control in many parts of the country, and we 
get from the administration nothing but confusion, 
disinformation, and quack miracle cures coming from the highest 
levels.",Concerns over COVID-19 Response and Lack of Clarity,"The excerpt highlights concerns about the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

 Also related is the ongoing threat of misinformation and 
disinformation, especially when it targets America's free and 
democratic elections. As the IC noted in its recent assessment, 
Russia undertook a sophisticated disinformation campaign in 
2020 to undercut our current President and to bolster the 
candidacy of the former one. We need to make clear that those 
who perpetrated this hostile interference will again pay a 
price.
    The technologies that have made misinformation and 
disinformation so effective have also been used to great effect 
by the types of people and groups who attempted an insurrection 
against our country. But domestic violent extremists were 
around long before January 6, and they'll continue to pose a 
significant threat long after we put that incident to rest.


 A rapidly-evolving technology has helped our country 
tremendously. It's helped the work you do; it's helped the work 
we do in public policy. But it's also advantaged our 
adversaries, none of whom, by the way, are constrained by laws 
or the sorts of commitments we've made to things like the rule 
of law or a moral compass and principles when it comes to 
utilizing things like deepfakes, advanced data analytics, 
disinformation, misinformation, artificial intelligence, and 
more. They are completely unrestrained from any of the things 
that we are restrained by, both in law and morality.


 And next, with respect to Russia, we assess that Moscow 
will continue to employ a variety of tactics to undermine U.S. 
influence and erode Western alliances. While Russia does not 
want to conflict with the United States, Russian officials have 
long believed that Washington is seeking to weaken Russia. And 
Moscow will use a range of tools to pursue its objectives, 
including mercenary operations, assassinations, and arms sales.
    It will also employ, as we've reported publicly, new 
weapons and cyber-capabilities to threaten the United States 
and its allies and seeks to use malign influence campaigns, 
including in the context of U.S. elections, to undermine our 
global standing, sow discord, and influence U.S. decision-
making. Russia is becoming increasingly adept at leveraging its 
technical prowess to develop asymmetric options in both the 
military and cyber spheres in order to give itself the ability 
to push back and force the United States to accommodate its 
interests.


 Emerging and disrupting technologies, as well as the 
proliferation and permeation of technology in all aspects of 
our lives, pose unique challenges. Cyber-capabilities to 
illustrate are demonstrably intertwined with threats from our 
infrastructure and to foreign malign influence threats against 
our democracy. And we need, as you have all stressed to us, to 
focus on the competition in critical technical areas such as 
high-performance computing, microelectronics, biotechnology, 
artificial intelligence, quantum computing, fiber optics, and 
metamaterials.


 Vice Chairman Rubio. The second topic I wanted to touch 
with you is, it's really based on your assessment. This is a 
quote from it:
    ``Beijing has been intensifying efforts to shape the 
political environment in the United States to promote its 
policy preferences, to mold public discourse, to pressure 
political figures whom Beijing believes oppose its interests, 
and muffle criticism of China on such issues as religious 
freedom and the suppression of democracy in Hong Kong.''
    We're all at this point, I think, well aware of Chinese--of 
Russian influence and disinformation efforts. But I think we 
make a mistake to not focus on both China's capabilities and on 
its growing and intensifying efforts to involve and engage 
itself in our political environment here in the United States. 
Different aims perhaps, different tactics in some ways, but 
certainly they have every capability that the Russians do, and 
more in many cases. And they are certainly interested in 
molding public discourse and creating pressure on political 
figures who they don't like here in the United States.
    I was hoping you could further elaborate on that for the 
benefit of the American public.


You note in your statement for the record that China, 
Russia, Iran, and North Korea have the ability, right now, to 
conduct cyberattacks on critical infrastructure and cause 
temporary disruptions. Additionally, in 2019 you provided 
examples, including China's ability to disrupt natural gas 
pipelines for a day to weeks, and Russia's ability to disrupt 
our electrical distribution networks for hours.


 So Director Wray, why is it that you cannot or won't tell 
the American people directly about the threat that adherents to 
the QAnon conspiracy theory presents?
    Director Wray. So, Senator, I appreciate your question.
    First, let me say that I think in our effort to get you 
information about what is in many cases ongoing law enforcement 
investigations, we were trying to give you as much information 
as we could in an unclassified way. I recognize the FOUO 
dimension complicated things. And my understanding is that my 
staff is working with yours, and we should be able to get you a 
fully unclassified version very shortly.
    In the meantime, let me say this. You know, we focus on the 
violence and the Federal criminal activity, regardless of the 
inspiration. We understand QAnon to be more of a reference to a 
complex conspiracy theory or set of complex conspiracy theories 
largely promoted online, which has morphed into more of a 
movement. And like a lot of other conspiracy theories, the 
effects of COVID--anxiety, social insulation, social isolation, 
financial hardship, et cetera--all exacerbate people's 
vulnerability to those theories. And we are concerned about the 
potential that those things can lead to violence.
	And where it is an inspiration for a Federal crime, we're 
going to aggressively pursue it. And in fact, we have arrested 
at least five self-identified QAnon adherents related to the 
January 6 attack specifically.
    Senator Heinrich. Director, let me follow-up a little bit 
on that. You're no doubt familiar with some of the public 
speculation that Q is really Ron Watkins, the administrator of 
the Internet image board 8kun, formerly known as 8chan. Whether 
or not Watkins is Q, he and his father clearly are responsible 
for hosting these sites and co-opting further in the QAnon 
conspiracy phenomenon.
    Given the prominent role that QAnon did play in the January 
6 attack on the Capitol, what are the potential legal 
repercussions for those who might be primarily responsible for 
propagating these sorts of dangerous and in some cases violent 
messages in these forums?
    Director Wray. Well, I think your question starts to raise 
different legal theories. We obviously, again, have to be 
careful to be focused on violence, threats of violence, and 
things that violate Federal criminal law. That doesn't mean 
that rhetoric isn't a societal problem that doesn't need to be 
addressed. But from the FBI's perspective, from a law 
enforcement perspective, we try to be very careful to focus on 
violence, threats of violence, and associated Federal criminal 
activity.
    There may be certain instances where language becomes part 
of a conspiracy, for example. And there are instances where 
there are other Federal statutes which may be violated. But 
again, those are complicated questions which I would refer to 
the lawyers over at the Justice Department.
	 Senator Heinrich. So for any of you, as a follow-up, I 
think a few years ago as a Nation, we really put enormous 
effort into understanding the mechanisms by which violent 
extremists and groups like the Islamic state, for example, 
became radicalized in chat rooms and online forums.
    Are we applying that rigor to the DVE radicalization 
problem?
    Director Wray. So we are using our joint terrorism task 
forces, of which we have over 200 all around the country, to 
investigate not just the homegrown violent extremists, the 
Jihadist-inspired terrorists, but also the domestic violent 
extremists. And certainly in both cases, there are a lot of 
parallels. You have individuals largely able to connect online. 
It provides a greater decentralized connectivity. And as I have 
said before, terrorism today--and that includes domestic 
violent extremism--moves at the speed of social media. And so 
that means recruitment. That means planning, training, 
dissemination of propaganda, et cetera. All those things that 
apply and that happen on the Jihadist-inspired side in many 
cases are also happening on the domestic violent extremist 
side. Obviously, there are on the domestic extremist side, 
Constitutional protections, and chronic and legal challenges 
that we have to be mindful of, especially given some of the 
history in this country clearly.


 Director Haines. Thank you, Senator King.
    I think it's an excellent question, and it's one obviously 
that we're struggling within a series of areas in our 
discussion of DVE, in our discussion of cyber, in areas like 
malign influence, and so on. And I think, from at least my 
perspective, we are working through each of these issues very 
carefully to ensure that we're complying with the law; that 
we're within our authorities; that we're doing what we should 
be doing. And taking into account privacy and civil liberties 
and the questions that are so critical to anytime that we are 
collecting intelligence along these lines and trying to 
combine, in effect, domestic and intelligence sources.


  Director Wray. So, certainly, social media has become in 
many ways the key amplifier to domestic violent extremism, just 
as it has for malign foreign influence, which we've discussed 
at great length with the Committee as well. It proves a level 
of the same things that attract people to it for good reasons, 
are also capable of causing all kinds of harms that we're 
entrusted with trying to protect the American people against.
    So, it creates speed dissemination, efficiency, 
accessibility--I referred to before, a level of decentralized 
connectivity. I think I would say that both, with respect to 
malign foreign influence and with respect to domestic violent 
extremism, people need to understand better what the 
information is that they are reading. A greater level of 
discerning skepticism is a crucial ingredient not just to 
protect from foreign misinformation, but also of violent 
extremism.


 Senator Cornyn. General Nakasone, in the recent hearing we 
had on the SolarWinds hack, the issue of notification by 
victims of hacking was raised. And indeed, I believe Senator 
Collins has advocated for a long time in a piece of legislation 
that victims of cyberattacks notify the Federal Government in 
some manner to provide context and complete knowledge of what's 
out there. It seems to me that otherwise, we're looking through 
a soda straw at some of the threats. Do you think requiring 
victims of cyberattacks in the United States, requiring them to 
notify the Federal Government in some way, maybe 
confidentially, is a good idea?
    General Nakasone. Senator, as we were discussing this 
morning, I think to understand the depth and breadth of any 
intrusion in the United States, we're going to have to have 
some means upon which we understand what has taken place. And 
so, obviously the policymakers and yourselves, the legislators, 
will determine that, but I think that's a key component of it 
as well.


 Director Haines, I also want to praise your statement. I 
think that your opening statement on behalf of the whole 
community today was incredibly strong. I want to highlight a 
couple of pieces. But I want to admit that in a way I'm just 
riffing on where Chairman Warner opened, that when you do an 
around-the-world threat assessment of what the challenges are 
that we face--and I think Marco, the Vice Chairman, said 
something very similar--I think his riff was more than 90 
percent of all the intelligence and national security 
challenges the American people and our troops face around the 
world, more than 90 percent of them originate in the five bad 
guy category of: long-term tech race with the Chinese Communist 
Party, Russia sowing disinformation and corruption and 
cyberattacks abroad, Iranian nukes and sponsorship of terrorism 
abroad, North Korean nukes, and a grab-bag of Jihadis. Those 
five things are the five big threats we face. There aren't two 
and there aren't really 20 that need to be on that top tier 
list. There are five.


 So I'd like a little more analysis about if there are other 
authorities that are needed. And I've heard you all say you 
don't need other authorities, but I guess I'm not willing to 
accept that we are going to have blind spots. I think there has 
to be an appropriate way to give the tools that our 
Intelligence Community needs to be able to constantly protect 
against cyber threat, cyber terrorism, and cyberattack.
    Director Haines. Thank you, Senator.
    I'll just start, and obviously I'll leave the bulk of the 
answer to General Nakasone, who will have more views on the 
specifics in this area. But I would say that--I think, really 
support the law that is currently being considered, which is 
basically something that would create, as I understand it, an 
obligation on companies to provide information when there are 
attacks, much like FireEye did in the context of SolarWinds. 
And that is something that I think would be useful.
    It is obviously one piece of the puzzle, and I think 
General Nakasone can speak with greater authority on what 
specifically the other issues are, and answering your further 
questions.","Addressing the Threat of Misinformation, Disinformation, and Cyberattacks","Testimonies and discussions highlight the ongoing threat posed by misinformation and disinformation campaigns targeting America's democratic processes, including elections. Both foreign and domestic actors utilize rapidly evolving technologies to spread false narratives and manipulate public discourse, posing significant challenges to national security. Efforts to counter these threats involve enhancing cyber defenses, improving information sharing between government agencies and private sector entities, and implementing policies to address extremist ideologies online. Additionally, the importance of understanding and addressing threats from foreign adversaries like Russia and China, who seek to undermine U.S. influence and erode democratic institutions, is emphasized. Coordination among government agencies, legislative action, and public awareness are essential in confronting these multifaceted challenges effectively."

Ms. Meng. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And thank you to our witnesses for your work and for being 
here today.
    I actually wanted to follow up on Mr. Aderholt's 
questioning about social media. Platforms like Twitter and 
Facebook have really played a central role in elevating 
conspiracy theories, hate, bigotry.
    And while some of these companies have occasionally banned 
from their platforms certain individuals or dangerous rhetoric, 
there are still other social media apps like Parler, Telegraph, 
or even Signal. And I just wanted to know what some of these 
companies can do. And I know that I have heard that platforms 
like Signal, for example, are even harder to sort of monitor. 
So what can these companies do better and what can Congress do?
    And the second part of this question: Are there any 
noticeable trends after the January 6th insurrection that you 
are seeing with how domestic right-wing groups are using some 
of these platforms?
    Ms. Sanborn. Yes, thank you for the question. I will start. 
You know, we have a very good relationship with a lot of the 
private sector partners that you mentioned in your question. 
And so that relationship is always increasing, and I am 
encouraged by the cooperation with them.


 So, Ms. Sanborn, we talked a bit today already about the 
rise of this toxic discourse, this toxic disinformation. And if 
you could expand more, we could hear more about the role of 
social media and what social media and even direct media, some 
of the networks who seem to think this is a good thing in 
radicalizing and recruiting individuals who are receptive to 
this extremist messaging.
    Ms. Sanborn. Yeah. I think we talked about it a little bit, 
but, obviously, social media has increased, not only the speed, 
but the ability to disseminate and the accessibility of all 
kinds of violent extremist rhetoric, both international and 
domestic. I am, again, very happy with the amount of 
cooperation that we get with the social media companies. We 
spend a lot of time. There is always, of course, room for 
growth on that, but as I mentioned, sort of educating them on 
what the threats are that we face allows them to be very 
thoughtful and mindful as they think about their terms of use. 
And I think that is a great sign and definitely a move forward.


 Mr. Trone. What do you think, though, about some of our 
networks that actually have an opinion? It is no longer the 
news. It is instead their position and what they think the news 
means and are pushing people to the left or pushing people to 
the right. Do you think that serves as sort of a backdrop, a 
supporting mechanism to ferment these radicalized behaviors? 
Because a lot of information we are hearing on respected 
networks is clearly disinformation.
    Ms. Sanborn. Yes. I think that is an interesting topic. I 
don't really think I know enough specifically to have an 
opinion one way or the other, but I do think, you know, we 
talked about this a little bit briefly, but we really take to 
heart our dual-headed mission of protecting an individual's 
First Amendment rights, as much as it is our right to protect 
the American people. And so we are very cognizant of trying to 
walk the line of really focusing on the violence and the intent 
and not focusing on necessarily the ideology or the even 
assembly with like-minded individuals. We look really closely 
at trying to find that individual that is about ready to break 
Federal law.


 Mr. Aderholt. Thank you. Sometimes politicians will, in my 
opinion, inaccurately claim that President Trump called White 
supremacists ``fine people'', and that can provoke heated 
reactions. For either witness, do you believe that efforts to 
combat disinformation can help to counteract the growth of 
domestic terrorism?
    Ms. Sanborn. I don't really have--I don't know a background 
or enough information to comment on like specific 
disinformation avenues.
    Mr. Wiegmann. I would just add, yeah, I do think that 
disinformation is something that we are concerned about in the 
administration; in other words, I think conspiracy theories and 
so forth are things that can contribute to a culture of 
violence in general. It is a difficult problem, but it is 
something that, I think, that we want to wrestle with. In other 
words, domestic terrorism or other types of violence just with 
the prevalence of social media and so forth, it is something 
that is--that we need to be concerned about.


 Mr. Wiegmann. So I agree with that. And then I would also 
just say on the other side of it is identifying people when 
people do what Jill said and identify someone who they think is 
headed down a path towards violence, we have worked on violence 
prevention programs with local communities where we can try to 
work to turn people away from violence, as Jill explained 
earlier, can be idiosyncratic. They may have personal 
grievances mixed up with kind of conspiracy theories they see 
online, mixed up with other problems they may be having. And if 
we can have interventions with those individuals, if they can 
be flagged to us, then there may be other ways, even apart from 
the criminal justice system, that they can be turned away from 
violence.


 Mr. Trone. Well, that is great. Thank you very much. Let's 
jump to cyber attacks. You know, increasing threats not just 
against the government but also the business world that you 
come from and I come from. And I will see Homeland Security and 
other defense intelligence agencies play a leading role. But 
NIST has an important role here, too.
    I would like you to actually tell us as much as you can, 
publicly, about the extent of the impacts to the Department of 
the SolarWinds Act, and how much have we recovered from the 
damage that was done?
    Secretary Raimondo. Yeah. Thank you for the question. You 
know, it was significant. And as a result, we are taking it 
very, very seriously. I can assure you that cyber will continue 
to be the main area of focus for NIST. Actually, in Rockville, 
Maryland, NIST has the Cybersecurity Center of Excellence, and 
cyber will continue to be a great focus for us. As I said, 
there will be a lot more money coming into NIST. Commerce is 
also at the center of the ICTS work that the President signed 
his executive order on that. And in that work, we are going to 
be not only securing, you know, Federal Government networks, 
but also, looking to help small- and medium-sized companies who 
are increasingly hit with these attacks and, frankly, don't 
necessarily know how to handle it. And, so, that will be a 
continued focus for us.


  Mr. Cline. I am glad that you are supportive of keeping 
Huawei on the Entity List. You mentioned also a strong patent 
system, and I share that position. But last year, an OIG report 
highlighted deficiencies in the PTO's Patent Capture and 
Application Processing System. The report found that PTO has no 
assurance that it can restore critical applications in the 
event of system failure, or a cyber attack. And that the 
USPTO's continued delay in updating legacy systems rendered a 
$4 million per-year alternate processing site adequate and 
impractical.",Addressing Cyber Threats and Social Media Disinformation,"The hearing highlighted growing concerns about cybersecurity threats and the role of social media in disseminating extremist rhetoric and disinformation. Witnesses emphasized the need for improved cooperation between government agencies and private sector partners to combat cyber threats effectively.

",Cyber Defense and Attribution Act,"The Cyber Defense and Attribution Act proposes amendments to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to facilitate the use of attributional technology and active cyber defense measures against cyber intrusions originating from Chinese state commercial actors or affiliated entities. The act exempts certain activities related to attributional technology from prosecution under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and provides a defense for active cyber defense measures taken by victims of cyber intrusions. Additionally, it establishes notification requirements for the use of active cyber defense measures, aiming to enhance collaboration between defenders and law enforcement agencies in addressing cyber threats. The act also includes a sense of Congress regarding the regulation of Chinese state-owned media outlets operating in the United States to mitigate the spread of Chinese propaganda."

``SEC. 319A. AUDIT AND REPORT ON DISBURSEMENTS BY FOREIGN NATIONALS.

    ``(a) Audit.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Commission shall conduct an audit 
        after each Federal election cycle to determine the incidence of 
        illicit foreign money in such Federal election cycle.
            ``(2) Procedures.--In carrying out paragraph (1), the 
        Commission shall conduct random audits of any disbursements 
        required to be reported under this Act, in accordance with 
        procedures established by the Commission.
    ``(b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the end of each 
Federal election cycle, the Commission shall submit to Congress a 
report containing--
            ``(1) results of the audit required by subsection (a)(1);
            ``(2) an analysis of the extent to which illicit foreign 
        money was used to carry out disinformation and propaganda 
        campaigns focused on depressing turnout among rural communities 
        and the success or failure of these efforts, together with 
        recommendations to address these efforts in future elections;
            ``(3) an analysis of the extent to which illicit foreign

            ``(5) recommendations to address the presence of illicit 
        foreign money in elections, as appropriate.

 (9) The reach of a few large internet platforms--larger 
        than any broadcast, satellite, or cable provider--has greatly 
        facilitated the scope and effectiveness of disinformation 
        campaigns. For instance, the largest platform has over 
        210,000,000 American users--over 160,000,000 of them on a daily 
        basis. By contrast, the largest cable television provider has 
        22,430,000 subscribers, while the largest satellite television 
        provider has 21,000,000 subscribers. And the most-watched 
        television broadcast in United States history had 118,000,000 
        viewers.

 (14) In testimony before the Senate Select Committee on 
        Intelligence titled, ``Disinformation: A Primer in Russian 
        Active Measures and Influence Campaigns'', multiple expert 
        witnesses testified that while the disinformation tactics of 
        foreign adversaries have not necessarily changed, social media 
        services now provide ``platform[s] practically purpose-built 
        for active measures[.]'' Similarly, as Gen. Keith B. Alexander 
        (RET.), the former Director of the National Security Agency, 
        testified, during the Cold War ``if the Soviet Union sought to 
        manipulate information flow, it would have to do so principally 
        through its own propaganda outlets or through active measures 
        that would generate specific news: planting of leaflets, 
        inciting of violence, creation of other false materials and 
        narratives. But the news itself was hard to manipulate because 
        it would have required actual control of the organs of media, 
        which took long-term efforts to penetrate. Today, however, 
        because the clear majority of the information on social media 
        sites is uncurated and there is a rapid proliferation of 
        information sources and other sites that can reinforce 
        information, there is an increasing likelihood that the 
        information available to average consumers may be inaccurate 
        (whether intentionally or otherwise) and may be more easily 
        manipulable than in prior eras.''.

 (18) Findings from a 2017 study on the manipulation of 
        public opinion through social media conducted by the 
        Computational Propaganda Research Project at the Oxford 
        Internet Institute found that the Kremlin is using pro-Russian 
        bots to manipulate public discourse to a highly targeted 
        audience. With a sample of nearly 1,300,000 tweets, researchers 
        found that in the 2016 election's 3 decisive States, propaganda 
        constituted 40 percent of the sampled election-related tweets 
        that went to Pennsylvanians, 34 percent to Michigan voters, and 
        30 percent to those in Wisconsin. In other swing States, the 
        figure reached 42 percent in Missouri, 41 percent in Florida, 
        40 percent in North Carolina, 38 percent in Colorado, and 35 
        percent in Ohio.

(23) A 2020 report by the bipartisan and bicameral U.S. 
        Cyberspace Solarium Commission found that ``Although foreign 
        nationals are banned from contributing to U.S. political 
        campaigns, they are still allowed to purchase U.S. political 
        advertisements online, making the internet a fertile 
        environment for conducting a malign influence campaign to 
        undermine American elections.'' The Commission concluded that 
        Russian interference in the 2016 election was and still is 
        possible, ``because the FECA, which establishes rules for 
        transparency in television, radio, and print media political 
        advertising, has not been amended to extend the same political 
        advertising requirements to internet platforms,'' and that 
        ``[a]pplying these standards across all media of communication 
        would, among other things, increase transparency of funding for 
        political advertisements, which would in turn strengthen 
        regulators' ability to reduce improper foreign influence in our 
        elections.''

(26) Multiple reports have indicated that online ads have 
        become a key vector for strategic influence by the People's 
        Republic of China. An April 2021 Wall Street Journal report 
        noted that the Chinese government and Chinese state-owned 
        enterprises are major purchasers of ads on the U.S.'s largest 
        social media platform, including to advance Chinese propaganda.",Enhancing Election Integrity Act of 2024,"The ""Enhancing Election Integrity Act of 2024"" focuses on safeguarding the integrity of federal elections in the United States by addressing the influence of illicit foreign money and disinformation campaigns. The act mandates the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to conduct audits after each federal election cycle to determine the presence of illicit foreign funds. It requires the submission of a report to Congress analyzing the extent and impact of foreign-funded disinformation and propaganda campaigns targeting specific communities, including rural, minority, military, and veteran populations. Additionally, the act highlights the role of social media platforms in facilitating the spread of disinformation and emphasizes the need for transparency in political advertising across all media channels. The act aims to strengthen regulations to mitigate improper foreign influence in U.S. elections and enhance election integrity.

 But I am also concerned, and I want to hit this very hard, 
that the AI systems can be used in ways that really are counter 
to how you want our country to evolve. It can supercharge 
adversaries' disinformation campaigns. Most of the 
disinformation campaigns that I have looked at have been done 
by large groups of presumably poorly paid and badly managed 
Russians. Imagine when the same technology is used in scalable 
machine learning at a scale that is much more pervasive.


In the context of homeland security, we see promise in 
applying AI to border protection, cyber defense, critical 
infrastructure protection, counterterrorism, and 
counterintelligence investigations. It will also be central to 
countering malign information operations designed to create or 
deepen fissures in our society and undermine confidence in the 
electoral process.


 The Commissioners. As the Commission noted in our Interim Report, 
private sector leaders and government officials must build a shared 
sense of responsibility for the welfare and security of the American 
people. The government needs help from industry and academia to 
maximize the promise of AI and minimize the national security risks 
posed by AI. American companies are at the forefront of AI 
developments. Their investments dwarf federal R&D; they generate many 
of the major breakthroughs; and, they are on the frontlines of 
defending against cyber threats and malicious uses of AI applications. 
To harness the full potential of private sector innovation, the 
government must adapt internally, modernizing its platforms, policies, 
and procedures to improve access to commercial breakthroughs and create 
the environmental conditions for success. At the same time, the 
government must also grow the innovation base, investing in early-stage 
AI research across the commercial sector and academia. In our first 
quarter and second quarter memos, the Commission recommended a number 
of Executive and Legislative Branch actions that the U.S. Government 
could take to improve its ability to leverage commercial advances in 
AI. While no single recommendation will ensure successful partnership 
between the private sector, academia, and the government, the 
Commission believes that these actions could set in motion a closer 
collaboration between the two sectors, as they would forge a common 
commitment to protecting our values, free market principles, national 
defense, and security.",Safeguarding National Security in the Age of A,"The text addresses concerns about the potential misuse of AI technology in ways that could undermine national security and democratic processes. It highlights the risk of AI being utilized to supercharge adversaries' disinformation campaigns, particularly emphasizing the threat posed by scalable machine learning. Despite these risks, there is recognition of the promise of AI in various aspects of homeland security, including border protection, cyber defense, critical infrastructure protection, counterterrorism, and counterintelligence investigations. The Commission emphasizes the need for collaboration between the private sector, government, and academia to harness the benefits of AI while mitigating its associated risks. Recommendations are made for government adaptation, modernization, and investment in AI research to ensure successful partnerships and protection of national values and security."

    In our democracies today, it is more evident than ever that 
disinformation is a persistent reality and a true threat. In 
fact, many experts say there will not be an election in 2020 
that is not impacted by active disinformation. Given this 
threat, we need to mobilize solutions. At Internews, we have 
learned that the most effective investment against 
disinformation is to invest in good information, good, 
accurate, local information. We also need to invest in critical 
thinking. We also need to disincentive the market forces that 
drive some of this disinformation. And finally, we need to hold 
companies and governments to account for their role in what is 
happening here.",Investing in Solutions to Combat Disinformation,"The statement emphasizes the critical need to address disinformation, which poses a persistent threat to democracies worldwide. The foundation is pursuing new technology-driven programs to expand economic empowerment, improve cybersecurity, and combat disinformation, particularly in Pacific Island nations vital to U.S. interests. To sustain these efforts, the foundation requests support of $20 million in funding for fiscal year 2021. At Internews, the focus is on investing in accurate local information, promoting critical thinking, and discouraging market forces driving disinformation. Additionally, there's a call to hold companies and governments accountable for their roles in combating disinformation."

 So, the number of people that have died from COVID that are

 Mr. Martin. Thank you, Chairwoman Horn, Ranking Member 
Babin, and Members of the Subcommittee. The NASA Office of 
Inspector General has conducted a significant amount of 
oversight work to help NASA improve its information technology 
governance, while securing its networks and data from cyber 
attacks. Over the past 5 years we issued 16 audit reports, with 
72 recommendations related to IT governance and security. 
During this same period we've conducted more than 120 
investigations involving intrusions, denial of service attacks, 
and data breaches on NASA networks, several of which have 
resulted in criminal convictions. My testimony today is 
informed by this body of audit and investigative work.
     The soundness and security of its data and IT systems is 
central to NASA's success. The agency spends more than $2.2 
billion a year on a portfolio of IT assets that include 
hundreds of information systems used to control spacecraft, 
collect and process scientific data, and enable NASA personnel 
to collaborate with colleagues around the world. Given the 
valuable technical and intellectual capital NASA produces, its 
IT systems present a high value target for cyber criminals. The 
past 6 months in particular has tested the agency, as more than 
90 percent of NASA's workforce moved from onsite to remote work 
due to the pandemic. During this period, NASA has experienced 
an uptick in cyber threats, with phishing attempts doubling, 
and malware attacks rising substantially. This morning I offer 
three observations about the state of NASA's IT security and 
governance to provide context for the scope of its challenges.


 Where overall security is more reliant upon individual 
decisions made by employees and non-employees alike, even 
seasoned users who have developed behaviors in accordance with 
onsite protections face new challenges, and can find themselves 
less prepared to avoid the vulnerabilities exposed by the 
remote working environments. Employees are working under 
duress. COVID-19 continues to drive economic instability, 
health-related concerns, anxiety, and confusion. Employees are 
worried about meeting their basic needs, and are less likely to 
attend to seemingly lower priorities like cybersecurity. Cyber 
criminals exploit targets of opportunity. The shift in activity 
provides a larger attack surface, and leads to more 
opportunities for cyber criminals to use social engineering 
techniques such as fraud, misdirection, and disinformation to 
exploit those vulnerabilities.
     Users bring their entire selves online. If we use the 
public health analogy of treating the whole patient, we can 
strengthen the efficacy of guidance to engage in robust cyber 
hygiene activities. In public health practice, successful 
treatment is inextricably linked to the social and 
environmental conditions of its patients. Today, in the midst 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, we must recognize that while basic 
cyber hygiene practice is relatively doable under normal 
circumstances, these are not normal times. Our workers are 
distracted, frightened, and fatigued. This is especially true 
for the most vulnerable users. As such, strategies to 
strengthen the cybersecurity of teleworkers must consider the 
full spectrum of user experiences and address the complex 
realities of their needs.


Chairwoman Horn. OK. Thank you. Stepping back to the 
challenges from this year during COVID-19, I'll have a question 
for Mr. Martin and Mr. Seaton, and hopefully we'll have time to 
get to Dr. Burley, about a broader--the memo, Mr. Seaton, that 
your predecessor published on April 8 warned of increased 
attempts in cyberattacks, and--especially during COVID-19, and 
I'm--my first question is--to you, actually, then to Mr. 
Martin, how has the rate of cyberattacks changed since that 
memo in April, and what steps has the OCIO taken to respond to 
those increased attempts?
     Mr. Seaton. Well, we have seen an increase in phishing 
attacks, and a lower level of some other attacks, but honestly, 
the change to the pandemic operating model is consistent with 
how NASA has operated in the past. We've supported a mobile 
workforce, and so have put in place controls and technologies 
to mitigate against some of these threats, including automated 
prevention of phishing attacks. Because, when it comes down to 
it, you and I are the most vulnerable part of our IT security 
environments, the people, and so we try to put in place 
automated controls to actually make that easier for our 
employees, and I've, seen significant improvements in phishing 
protections over the last 2 years.",Safeguarding NASA's IT Infrastructure During Remote Operations,"The testimony highlights the critical importance of maintaining the security and integrity of NASA's information technology (IT) systems, particularly amidst the transition to remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The witness, Mr. Martin, underscores the increased cyber threats faced by NASA during this period, with a rise in phishing attempts and malware attacks. He emphasizes the need for robust IT governance and security measures to protect NASA's valuable technical and intellectual assets. Additionally, the testimony emphasizes the impact of the pandemic on employee cybersecurity awareness and the importance of addressing the complex realities of telework environments. Mr. Seaton discusses the measures implemented by NASA's Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) to mitigate cyber threats, including automated controls to prevent phishing attacks. Both witnesses stress the significance of continuous efforts to enhance cybersecurity protocols and adapt to the evolving threat landscape."

 We have seen elections which have worked to prove democracy 
works in that country, despite widespread Chinese Government 
meddling and attempts to spread disinformation, and it served 
as a referendum on the Chinese Government's long-standing 
efforts to adopt a one country/two systems model for Taiwan.


 Mr. Fritz. Thank you very much, Senator Coons.
    Let me start off by reiterating my gratitude to you and 
your colleagues for making the trip to Taiwan. As you know full 
well, at that time the Taiwan authorities were under a fairly 
extensive disinformation campaign trying to draw divisions not 
only on the island but also between Taiwan and the United 
States.
    I know it had a very galvanizing effect on the morale of 
the entire island. I have a picture from TECRO representative 
of the lit-up Grand Hotel with the giant U.S.A. emblazoned on 
it.
    I think you struck a great blow for Taiwan's democracy and 
against attempts by the PRC to undermine that democracy and sow 
discord. So thank you again for that.


 Taiwan's Ambassador indicated that she had actually 
received indication of texts coming from the Chinese Communist 
Party saying that Americans have so much vaccine that we are 
vaccinating our pets, and that we think more of our dogs than 
we think of the people of Taiwan.
    This kind of misinformation spreads throughout Taiwan, and, 
therefore, I want to underscore something that others have 
raised, which is the urgency for getting vaccines to the people 
of Taiwan.
    There is a need for about 2 million vaccinations. We have 
agreed to 750,000. I would strongly encourage us to move as 
soon as we can to the higher number and that we get these to 
the people of Taiwan as urgently as we possibly can.
    This is a nation, obviously, seeing a significant uptick in 
infections, given the Delta variant, and it has humanitarian 
implications, but also strategic implications that are very 
important, given the disinformation campaign that the Chinese 
are carrying out.
    Is what I am saying consistent with your own understanding 
of what is happening with regards to Chinese misinformation and 
is that happening on various fronts around the world?
    Mr. Fritz. Ranking Member Romney, you are absolutely right. 
I think Taiwan is probably receiving, you know, the brunt of 
PRC disinformation.
    On the other hand, we have also seen Taiwan develop quite a 
bit of resilience to this sort of thing. They are getting very 
good at identifying and pushing back with media literacy, 
social media literacy programs, transparency, basically, and we 
have actually quite a lot to learn from them in terms of 
combating disinformation.
    Back to the Global Cooperation and Training Framework, a 
platform that Senator Coons mentioned, we have been able to use 
that platform to take some of Taiwan's expertise and share it 
with others around the world who are also subjected to PRC 
disinformation but also disinformation from other bad actors, 
whether that be the Russians or others.
   

 Question. Last year, as mainland China became increasingly 
inhospitable for journalists, more than 20 journalists moved to Taiwan 
at the invitation of the Taiwanese Government. Many of them had 
published articles highlighting the Chinese Government's horrific 
abuses against Uyghurs or its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. 
What is the State Department doing to support the freedom of expression 
and defend Taiwan against any retaliation from the Chinese Government 
for hosting these journalists?

    Answer. The PRC has displayed an ongoing pattern of attempts to 
intimidate the region, including through the suppression of free 
speech. Additionally, Beijing continues to exert military, diplomatic, 
and economic pressure against Taiwan instead of engaging in meaningful 
dialogue with Taiwan.
    Taiwan is a leading democracy, a vibrant economic partner, a 
technology powerhouse, and a strong example of how an open society can 
contain COVID-19 and contribute to global health. Taiwan has also 
become a global leader in combating disinformation.
    U.S. support for Taiwan is rock-solid, and we will continue to work 
with allies and partners to highlight the positive role that Taiwan 
plays in addressing global challenges and encourage them to stand with 
Taiwan in defending against threats to its democratic values, including 
freedom of the press.",Defending Taiwan Against Chinese Disinformation and Supporting Freedom of Expression,"The discussion highlights Taiwan's resilience against Chinese disinformation during critical moments like elections. Senator Coons' visit boosted morale and countered PRC's attempts to undermine Taiwan's democracy. Emphasis is placed on urgently providing vaccines to Taiwan amid COVID-19 and CCP misinformation. Taiwan's proactive approach in combating disinformation serves as a model. The State Department reaffirms strong support for Taiwan's democracy and freedom of expression, stressing the need to defend against threats to democratic values and seek international solidarity."

 Vice Chairman Rubio. Okay.
    I'm sure there will be more follow-up but I don't want to 
take all of our time on that. I know other Members may want to 
dig into a little bit deeper. I didn't want to skip going to 
Mr. Holmgren.
    Foreign misinformation, informational warfare is a reality. 
It's growing. It's always been there but we've now seen it sort 
of diffuse and become a real weapon used in global competition.
    What is or should be, through the Global Engagement Center, 
the INR's role in supporting the Global Engagement Center 
efforts? In essence, you know, how can we counter through the 
Global Engagement Center the impact that disinformation and 
misinformation campaigns are having, not just people think of 
Russia, I mean, Iran and others are heavily engaged now in this 
effort in the Western Hemisphere even. So how do you view the 
role of the Global Engagement Center and your role, in 
particular, in supporting those efforts?
    Mr. Fonzone. Thank you, Vice Chairman, for that important 
question.
    Russia's interference in the 2016, you know, election was 
an outrageous attack on our democracy. It was an attempt to sow 
discord, to exacerbate divisions in our country, and it is an 
effort, as the DNI has indicated, it's likely to be, you know, 
replicated by other Nations besides Russia moving forward. And 
so I think it absolutely is a serious issue that we must 
confront. You know, I publicly called for the need for a whole 
of government approach to combat foreign malign disinformation 
and influence campaigns.
    And so, Vice Chairman, to your question about the role that 
State and INR, in particular, would play, I would view, if 
confirmed, INR's role as providing support to the Global 
Engagement Center, but also to the recently established Foreign 
Malign Influence Center that the DNI created, which I think is 
a very positive step in the right direction to fuse a lot of 
the intelligence and threat information to share with 
policymakers.


 Senator Gillibrand. Okay. Mr. Fonzone, if confirmed you 
will be the top lawyer in the Intelligence Community. What 
would be your advice to the DNI regarding the role of the 
Intelligence Community in addressing the threat of domestic 
terrorism? Where do you see that line of authorities between 
the significant domestic national security threat, the 
Intelligence Community's capability, and the law enforcement 
community?
    And related, we've seen such an intense influx of 
cyberattacks by sophisticated foreign adversaries who have 
utilized U.S. computing infrastructure to mask the origin of 
attacks. This has also raised concerns that the perpetrators 
are exploiting a perceived gap in intelligence authorities that 
make it difficult for the IC to track cyber threats on domestic 
networks.
    If confirmed as the top intelligence lawyer in the U.S. 
Government, what would be your advice to the DNI regarding the 
intelligence authorities needed to better defend the United 
States from these type of attacks?
    Mr. Fonzone. Thank you, Senator, for the question. I think 
you flagged two very difficult legal issues where the threats 
can span the domestic to the international, and drawing a line 
between where the IC's authorities are and where the 
authorities of other entities who are responsible for 
addressing those threats are. If confirmed, I think both cyber 
security and domestic threats would be areas of major focus for 
me.",Congressional Inquiry on Countering Foreign Disinformation and Cyber Threats,"During a congressional inquiry, Vice Chairman Rubio and Senator Gillibrand question Mr. Fonzone on combating foreign disinformation and cyber threats. The discussion focuses on the role of the Global Engagement Center (GEC) and the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) in countering misinformation campaigns orchestrated by nations like Russia, Iran, and others. Mr. Fonzone emphasizes the need for a comprehensive government approach to combat foreign disinformation and intelligence sharing to address these threats effectively. Additionally, Senator Gillibrand seeks insights on the Intelligence Community's role in addressing domestic terrorism and defending against cyberattacks. Mr. Fonzone emphasizes the complexity of these legal issues and highlights cybersecurity and domestic threats as major areas of focus if confirmed as the top intelligence lawyer in the U.S. Government."

 Mr. Langevin [continuing]. The breach of Twitter that saw 
many prominent accounts linking to a Bitcoin scam. It doesn't 
take much imagination to see what chaos one could sow with such 
access on Election Day if a bad actor was pushing out 
disinformation.


Our adversaries have noticed the broader attack surface. Just 
yesterday, CISA--in conjunction with allies in the United Kingdom and 
Canada--announced that Russian operatives are targeting health care 
organizations doing research on the virus. And 2 days ago, we saw a 
major breach of Twitter that saw many prominent accounts linking to a 
Bitcoin scam. It doesn't take much imagination to see what chaos one 
could sow with such access on Election Day if a bad actor was pushing 
out disinformation.
    The realities of 2020 make clear that a comprehensive, whole-of-
Nation approach to cybersecurity is a necessity, but we do not yet have 
one. We lack a clear leader in the White House whose mission it is to 
focus on cybersecurity. We lack clear understanding of roles and 
responsibilities, both within Government and between Government and the 
private sector. We lack clear metrics to measure our progress.
    The Cyberspace Solarium Commission report cannot fix all the 
challenges we have in cyber space. But it does chart a bold course, and 
it does not shy away from the trade-offs we will need to make to 
decisively improve our cybersecurity posture. The report makes clear 
that everyone--from Government to private-sector companies to Congress 
itself--needs to make meaningful changes.


As Ranking Member on the Cybersecurity, Infrastructure 
Protection, and Innovation Subcommittee, my top priority among 
the commission's recommendations is strengthening and 
clarifying CISA's authority, and vastly increasing its funding 
to allow it to carry out its role as the Nation's risk manager, 
coordinating the protection of critical infrastructure and 
Federal agencies and departments from cyber threats.
    I introduced this recommendation as a bill, together with 
Mr. Ruppersberger, and cosponsored his amendment to the NDAA, 
which requires CISA to assess what additional resources are 
necessary to fulfill its mission. This assessment should 
examine CISA's work force composition and future demands, and 
report to Congress on the findings.


The recommendations I am most interested in hearing about today 
are, strengthening the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency 
(CISA) and its workforce, evaluating CISA's facilities needs, 
strengthening the CISA director position and making the assistant 
directors career, the National cyber director, authorizing CISA to 
threat hunt on the .gov domain, securing email, developing a strategy 
to secure email, and modernizing the digital infrastructure of State 
and local governments and small and mid-sized businesses.

 Statement of Chairman Bennie G. Thompson
                             July 17, 2020
    At the outset, I want to acknowledge how fortunate we are, as 
Members of Congress, to have before us a whole-of-Government, public/
private-sector blueprint for defending the Nation against future cyber 
attacks. Too often, thoughtful documents like this are the product of 
Monday morning quarterbacking that takes place after a catastrophic 
event has occurred.


  So that was the work of the commission. We went through, as 
I mentioned, 30 meetings together. We had stress tests. We had 
a sort-of contest of ideas in the middle of last summer, and we 
really tried to approach this with fresh eyes to look at, 
really, 2 basic questions: What should our strategy be, and 
what should our organizational structure be to--both to 
protect, to prepare, and to prevent cyber attacks?
    As you mentioned, there are 82 recommendations in the 
report, 54 of which have been converted into legislative 
recommendations and presented to the various committees of both 
the House and the Senate in the form of fully-drafted 
legislative proposals.
    What we are talking about is what is called layered cyber 
deterrence, and that means resilience so that our adversaries 
feel that there is not much to be gained by attacking us 
because of our security and our protection of our systems, but 
also a declaratory policy that, if attacked, we will respond.
    One of the deficiencies in our cyber posture over the last 
several decades has been we have a deterrence strategy for a 
major sort-of threshold of use of force, but we haven't had a 
strategy, and we haven't articulated a doctrine that would 
provide a deterrent for less than use-of-force kind of cyber 
attacks.
    For that reason, as I have said many times, we are a cheap 
date. Our adversaries don't--they don't compute the cost of 
attacking us. That has to change. That is the strategic 
picture.


 Joint Prepared Statement of Senator Angus King, Honorable Mike 
           Gallagher, Samantha Ravich, and Suzanne Spaulding
                             July 17, 2020
    The Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC) was established by the 
John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal 
Year 2019 to ``develop a consensus on a strategic approach to defending 
the United States in cyber space against cyber attacks of significant 
consequences.''


Second, the Government must continue to improve the resourcing, 
authorities, and organization of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency (CISA) in its role as the primary Federal agency 
responsible for critical infrastructure protection, security, and 
resilience. We recommend empowering CISA with tools to strengthen 
public-private partnership. Of particular value would be the 
authorities needed to aid in responding to attempted attacks on 
critical infrastructure from a variety of actors ranging from nation-
states to criminals. Currently, the U.S. Government's authorities are 
limited exclusively to certain criminal contexts, where evidence of a 
compromise exists, and do not address instances in which critical 
infrastructure systems are vulnerable to a cyber attack. To address 
this gap, Congress should grant CISA subpoena authority in support of 
their threat and asset response activities, while ensuring appropriate 
liability protections for cooperating private-sector network owners.


Throughout the process of developing its recommendations, the 
commission always considered Congress as its ``customer.'' Through the 
NDAA, Congress tasked the commission to investigate cyber threats that 
undermine American power and prosperity, to determine an appropriate 
strategic approach to protect the Nation in cyber space, and to 
identify policy and legislative solutions. As commissioners, we are 
here today to share what we learned, advocate for our recommendations, 
and work to assist you in any way we can to solve this serious and 
complex challenge.
	 intersection between pandemic and cyber crises
    The COVID-19 pandemic has been a big wakeup call for us all because 
it illustrates the challenge of ensuring resilience and continuity in a 
connected world. It is an example of a type of non-traditional National 
security crisis that spreads rapidly through the system, stressing 
everything from emergency services and supply chains to basic human 
needs. The pandemic has produced cascading effects and high levels of 
uncertainty. This situation undermines normal policy-making processes 
and forces decision makers to craft hasty and ad hoc emergency 
responses. Complex emergencies that rely on coordinated action beyond 
traditional agency responses and processes illustrate what the 
commission saw as an acute threat to the security of the United States.
    The lessons the country is still learning from the on-going 
pandemic are not perfectly analogous to a significant cyber attack, but 
are highly illustrative of the possible consequences due to several 
similarities between the 2 types of events. First, both the pandemic 
and a significant cyber attack are global in nature. Second, both the 
COVID-19 pandemic and a significant cyber attack require a whole-of-
Nation response and are likely to challenge existing incident 
management doctrine and coordination mechanisms. Finally, and perhaps 
most importantly, prevention is far cheaper and more effective than 
response.


 			the challenge
    For the last 20 years, adversaries have used cyber space to attack 
American power and interests. Our adversaries have not internalized the 
message that, if they attack us in cyber space, they will pay a price. 
The more connected and prosperous our society has become, the more 
vulnerable we are to rival great powers, rogue states, extremists, and 
criminals. These attacks on America occur beneath the threshold of 
armed conflict and create significant challenges for the private sector 
and the public at large.


  Russia targets the integrity and legitimacy of elections in 
multiple countries while actively probing critical infrastructure. In 
spring 2014, Russian-linked groups launched a campaign to disrupt 
Ukrainian elections that included attempts at altering vote tallies, 
disrupting election results through distributed-denial-of-service 
attacks, and smearing candidates by releasing hacked emails. They 
continue to spread hate and disinformation on social media to polarize 
free societies. But they have not stopped there. The 2017 NotPetya 
malware attack spread globally, Iran and North Korea attack U.S. and 
allied interests through cyber space. Iranian cyber operations have 
targeted the energy industry, entertainment sector, and financial 
institutions. There are also documented cases of Iranian APTs targeting 
dams in the United States with distributed-denial-of-service attacks. 
North Korea exploits global connectivity to skirt sanctions and sustain 
an isolated, corrupt regime. The 2017 WannaCry ransomware attacks hit 
over 300,000 computers in 150 countries, including temporarily 
disrupting U.K. hospitals. According to United Nations estimates, North 
Korean cyber operations earn $2 billion in illicit funds for the regime 
each year.


                         strategic approach
    The strategy put forth by the Cyberspace Solarium Commission 
combines a number of traditional deterrence mechanisms and extends 
their use beyond the Government to develop a whole-of-Nation approach. 
It also updates and strengthens our declaratory policy for cyber 
attacks both above and below the level of armed attack. The United 
States must demonstrate its ability to impose costs while establishing 
a clear declaratory policy that signals to rival states the costs and 
risks associated with attacking America in cyber space.
    Since America relies on critical infrastructure that is primarily 
owned and operated by the private sector, the Government cannot defend 
the Nation alone. The public and private sectors, along with key 
international partners, must collaborate to build resilience and 
reshape the cyber ecosystem in a manner that increases its security, 
while imposing costs against malicious actors and preventing attacks of 
significant consequence.


Layered cyber deterrence emphasizes working with the private sector 
to efficiently coordinate how the Nation responds with speed and 
agility to emerging threats. The Federal Government alone cannot fund 
or solve the challenge of adversaries attacking the networks on which 
America and its allies and partners rely. It requires collaboration 
with State and local authorities, leading business sectors, and 
international partners, all within the rule of law. This strategy also 
contemplates the planning needed to ensure the continuity of the 
economy and the ability of the United States to rebound in the 
aftermath of a major, Nation-wide cyber attack of significant 
consequence. Such planning adds depth to deterrence by assuring the 
American people, allies, and even our adversaries that the United 
States will have both the will and capability to respond to any attack 
on our interests. These 3 deterrent layers are supported by 6 policy 
pillars that organize the 82 recommendations that collectively 
represent the means to implement our strategy.


 Denying adversaries' benefits starts with ensuring that our most 
critical targets are able to withstand and quickly recover from cyber 
attacks. In other words, we must build resilience. Effective National 
resilience efforts fundamentally depend on the ability of the United 
States to accurately understand, assess, and manage National cyber 
risk. Current efforts to assess and manage risk at the National level 
are relatively new and are significantly hindered by resource 
limitations, immaturity of process, and inconsistent capacity across 
departments and agencies that participate in National resilience 
efforts. Today, while the U.S. Government plans for continuity of 
operations and continuity of Government, no similar planning exists to 
ensure continuity of the economy. This must change, and the planning 
process should analyze National critical functions, outlining 
priorities for response and recovery, and identifying areas for 
resilience investments. In doing so, the continuity of the economy plan 
should identify areas for preservation of data and mechanisms for 
extending short-term credit to ensure recovery efforts. Additionally, 
Congress should also provide CISA with the necessary support to expand 
its current capability to issue Cyber State of Distress declarations in 
conjunction with Cyber Response and Recovery Funding. Furthermore, 
providing CISA with Administrative Subpoena Authority will dramatically 
improve the Federal Government's ability to actively notify critical 
infrastructure owners and operators that are on the front lines and 
being attacked by our adversaries who are largely acting with impunity.


 Today, the United States has not created credible and sufficient 
costs against malicious adversary behavior below the level of armed 
attack--even as the United States has prevented cyber attacks of 
significant consequences. Our Nation must shift from responding to 
malicious behavior after it has already occurred to proactively 
observing, pursuing, and countering adversary operations. This should 
include imposing costs to change adversary behavior using all 
instruments of National power in accordance with international law.


If deterrence fails, the United States must also be confident that 
its military capabilities will work as intended. However, deterrence 
across all of the domains of warfare is undermined, and the ability of 
the United States to prevail in crisis and conflict is threatened, if 
adversaries can hold key military systems and functions, including 
nuclear systems, at risk through cyber means. Therefore, the commission 
recommends Congress direct the DoD to conduct a cybersecurity 
vulnerability assessment of all segments of nuclear command, control, 
and communications systems and continually assess weapon systems' cyber 
vulnerabilities.
    Our hope is that, by implementing these recommendations, we can 
ensure our Nation is willing and able to counter and reduce malicious 
adversary behavior below the level of armed conflict, impose costs to 
deter significant cyber attacks, and, if necessary, fight and win in 
crisis and conflict.


The 2019 NDAA charted the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission to 
address 2 fundamental questions: What strategic approach will defend 
the United States against cyber attacks of significant consequence? And 
what policies and legislation are required to implement that strategy? 
The commission has delivered on its mission in the promulgation of 
``layered cyber deterrence'' strategy and the corresponding legislative 
proposals. We now need your help to enact these key legislative 
proposals as they will empower the Government and the private sector to 
act with speed and agility in securing our cyber future.


Despite these well-intentioned efforts, our networks are 
vulnerable, if not already compromised. Our country has lost 
hundreds of billions of dollars to nation-state-sponsored 
intellectual property theft via cyber means. A major cyber 
attack on our Nation's critical infrastructure and our economic 
system would create chaos and lasting damage.


STATEMENT OF SAMANTHA RAVICH, PH.D., COMMISSIONER, CYBERSPACE 
                      SOLARIUM COMMISSION

    Ms. Ravich. Thank you. Thank you. Chairman Langevin, 
Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Katko, distinguished Members 
of the committee, and my fellow witnesses, whom I have grown to 
know and greatly admire over this past year. I thank you for 
inviting me to participate in this important hearing about one 
of the most pressing questions that our Government is currently 
tasked with answering: What steps can the Federal Government 
and the private sector do to defend our businesses, our 
military, our citizens, our country against future cyber 
attacks?
    Our recommendations in the Cyber Solarium Commission 
focused on shaping the international cyber battle space, 
hardening our resilience, and maintaining our capability, 
capacity, and credibility to impose costs on the adversary, all 
in the service of deterring the type of catastrophic attack 
that our 2 esteemed commission chairmen laid out in plainspeak 
in the opening pages of the report.


Creating and exercising a continuity-of-the-economy plan 
will serve as a visible deterrent to adversaries by 
demonstrating that the United States has the wherewithal to 
respond to a significant cyber attack. It will show that we 
will not be cowed, and that, if the economy upon which our 
livelihoods depend is brought down by an adversarial cyber 
attack, they, the adversary, will feel our wrath.


 Finally, COTE must take into consideration the lack of 
readiness by the general public. By its very nature, 
continuity-of-the-economy planning will not prioritize. It will 
only prioritize the most essential functions of the country and 
the locales, both to enable a rapid recovery from a devastating 
cyber attack, and to preserve the strength and will to quickly 
punish the attacker.


 COTE, along with many other recommendations in the report, 
seeks to build upon the work of the Cybersecurity and 
Information Security Agency, CISA, at DHS, what they have been 
working on for the past couple of years, and seeks to ensure 
that the United States is prepared to respond and recover to 
the full range of disruptive cyber attacks below and up to the 
threshold of COTE.
    While it is true that there is no magic solution that will 
protect the United States from cyber attacks in perpetuity, 
there are steps that the Federal Government can undertake that 
will significantly improve the Government's ability to protect 
and defend itself from hostile cyber operations.


I want to raise 2 questions as quickly as I can. Yesterday 
we were alerted to a coordinated hack of major U.S. Twitter 
accounts, including those of President Obama, Elon Musk, Bill 
Gates, Mike Bloomberg, and former U.S. President Joe Biden, and 
many others. At that time, where misinformation--at this time, 
where misinformation poses one of the greatest threats to 
National security, we need cybersecurity policy that will 
uphold the truth.


 As a representative from Illinois, a State that experienced 
a major cyber attack in our election system in 2016, I am well 
aware that such attacks pose a threat at all levels of 
government, and so a whole-of-Government response is required.
    In the last few months the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed 
this vulnerability like never before. As Americans have 
struggled to telework securely, overworked hospitals have 
suffered ransomware attacks. Cyber attacks have targeted 
vaccine developers, and more.
    I am pleased that the commission built on the 
recommendations in the March report by publishing a white paper 
in May on cybersecurity lessons from the pandemic. In this 
white paper, the commission found that maligned foreign 
disinformation operations are undermining public health: ``The 
resulting confusion is threatening to become a literal matter 
of life and death.''
    Ms. Spaulding, can you elaborate on how disinformation 
impacts our cybersecurity, public health, or other areas of 
National security, even to the point of life and death?
    Ms. Spaulding. Absolutely, Congresswoman, thank you for 
that really important question that--we have seen our 
adversaries take advantage of this situation, and putting out 
disinformation around COVID that confuses the public. It may 
not be that they are able to convince the public necessarily of 
the narrative that they are pushing, but they create confusion, 
which is deadly enough. If the public gives up, as I say, on 
their ability to figure out what is fact when--at a time when 
giving the American public facts about what they should be 
doing to protect themselves, their families, their communities, 
and our Nation, that is extremely destructive.
	 When we see the COVID coming together with our elections as 
election officials are making decisions about how to adjust, 
whether to adjust elections in light of the pandemic, and then 
those are winding up in courts--and we have seen disinformation 
around all 3 of those: COVID, elections, and the courts--and 
that is a really dangerous combination that threatens the 
peaceful transition of power.
    Ms. Underwood. Thank you. I agree with the commission's 
assessment of the severe and even deadly security threat posed 
by disinformation, which is why, in the last month, I 
introduced the Protecting Against Public Safety Disinformation 
Act. This bill would direct the Department of Homeland Security 
to assess maligned foreign disinformation operations that 
threaten public safety and share their findings with State and 
local authorities like public health departments, emergency 
managers, and first responders.
    The commission's recommendations repeatedly highlight the 
role of State and local officials in hardening our 
cybersecurity posture. Ms. Spaulding, why is it so important 
for State and local officials to be involved in our National 
response to disinformation and other cybersecurity threats?
    Ms. Spaulding. So we have gotten used to the idea that 
State and local officials are on the front lines of responding 
to disasters in the real world. We have to understand, as you 
say, that they are also often on the front lines of responding 
to disinformation that causes confusion in their communities.
",Strengthening National Cybersecurity: Recommendations and Challenges,"The testimony and statements provided by various officials and experts underscore the critical need for comprehensive cybersecurity measures in the face of evolving threats. Concerns about disinformation, cyber attacks on critical infrastructure, and the vulnerability of election systems are highlighted. Recommendations from the Cyberspace Solarium Commission emphasize the importance of a whole-of-nation approach, including strengthening the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and enhancing public-private partnerships. Additionally, the importance of resilience, continuity planning, and deterring malicious behavior is emphasized to safeguard against cyber threats. The intersection of cybersecurity and public health, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, is also discussed, with an emphasis on the dangers posed by disinformation campaigns. State and local involvement in cybersecurity efforts is highlighted as crucial for effective response and resilience."

including standards and best practices for procuring, maintaining, 
testing, operating, and updating election systems to prevent and deter 
cybersecurity incidents.

``SEC. 319B. AUDIT AND REPORT ON DISBURSEMENTS BY FOREIGN NATIONALS.

    ``(a) Audit.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Commission shall conduct an audit 
        after each Federal election cycle to determine the incidence of 
        illicit foreign money in such Federal election cycle.
            ``(2) Procedures.--In carrying out paragraph (1), the 
        Commission shall conduct random audits of any disbursements 
        required to be reported under this Act, in accordance with 
        procedures established by the Commission.
    ``(b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the end of each 
Federal election cycle, the Commission shall submit to Congress a 
report containing--
            ``(1) results of the audit required by subsection (a)(1);
            ``(2) an analysis of the extent to which illicit foreign 
        money was used to carry out disinformation and propaganda 
        campaigns focused on depressing turnout among rural communities 
        and the success or failure of these efforts, together with 
        recommendations to address these efforts in future elections;
            ``(3) an analysis of the extent to which illicit foreign 
        money was used to carry out disinformation and propaganda 
        campaigns focused on depressing turnout among African-American 
        and other minority communities and the success or failure of 
        these efforts, together with recommendations to address these

        money was used to carry out disinformation and propaganda 
        campaigns focused on influencing military and veteran 
        communities and the success or failure of these efforts, 
        together with recommendations to address these efforts in 
        future elections; and
            ``(5) recommendations to address the presence of illicit 
        foreign money in elections, as appropriate.

 (4) The reach of a few large internet platforms--larger 
        than any broadcast, satellite, or cable provider--has greatly 
        facilitated the scope and effectiveness of disinformation 
        campaigns. For instance, the largest platform has over 
        210,000,000 American users--over 160,000,000 of them on a daily 
        basis. By contrast, the largest cable television provider has 
        22,430,000 subscribers, while the largest satellite television 
        provider has 21,000,000 subscribers. And the most-watched 
        television broadcast in United States history had 118,000,000 
        viewers.

(9) In testimony before the Senate Select Committee on 
        Intelligence titled, ``Disinformation: A Primer in Russian 
        Active Measures and Influence Campaigns'', multiple expert 
        witnesses testified that while the disinformation tactics of 
        foreign adversaries have not necessarily changed, social media 
        services now provide ``platform[s] practically purpose-built 
        for active measures[.]'' Similarly, as Gen. Keith B. Alexander 
        (RET.), the former Director of the National Security Agency, 
        testified, during the Cold War ``if the Soviet Union sought to 
        manipulate information flow, it would have to do so principally 
        through its own propaganda outlets or through active measures 
        that would generate specific news: planting of leaflets, 
        inciting of violence, creation of other false materials and 
        narratives. But the news itself was hard to manipulate because 
        it would have required actual control of the organs of media, 
        which took long-term efforts to penetrate. Today, however, 
        because the clear majority of the information on social media 
        sites is uncurated and there is a rapid proliferation of 
        information sources and other sites that can reinforce 
        information, there is an increasing likelihood that the 
        information available to average consumers may be inaccurate 
        (whether intentionally or otherwise) and may be more easily 
        manipulable than in prior eras.''.

 (12) On September 6, 2017, the nation's largest social 
        media platform disclosed that between June 2015 and May 2017, 
        Russian entities purchased $100,000 in political 
        advertisements, publishing roughly 3,000 ads linked to fake 
        accounts associated with the Internet Research Agency, a pro-
        Kremlin organization. According to the company, the ads 
        purchased focused ``on amplifying divisive social and political 
        messages ***''.
            (13) Findings from a 2017 study on the manipulation of 
        public opinion through social media conducted by the 
        Computational Propaganda Research Project at the Oxford 
        Internet Institute found that the Kremlin is using pro-Russian 
        bots to manipulate public discourse to a highly targeted 
        audience. With a sample of nearly 1,300,000 tweets, researchers 
        found that in the 2016 election's 3 decisive States, propaganda 
        constituted 40 percent of the sampled election-related tweets 
        that went to Pennsylvanians, 34 percent to Michigan voters, and 
        30 percent to those in Wisconsin. In other swing States, the 
        figure reached 42 percent in Missouri, 41 percent in Florida, 
        40 percent in North Carolina, 38 percent in Colorado, and 35 
        percent in Ohio.

(18) A 2020 report by the bipartisan and bicameral U.S. 
        Cyberspace Solarium Commission found that ``Although foreign 
        nationals are banned from contributing to U.S. political 
        campaigns, they are still allowed to purchase U.S. political 
        advertisements online, making the internet a fertile 
        environment for conducting a malign influence campaign to 
        undermine American elections.'' The Commission concluded that 
        Russian interference in the 2016 election was and still is 
        possible, ``because the FECA, which establishes rules for 
        transparency in television, radio, and print media political 
        advertising, has not been amended to extend the same political 
        advertising requirements to internet platforms,'' and that 
        ``[a]pplying these standards across all media of communication 
        would, among other things, increase transparency of funding for 
        political advertisements, which would in turn strengthen 
        regulators' ability to reduce improper foreign influence in our 
        elections.''

(21) Multiple reports have indicated that online ads have 
        become a key vector for strategic influence by the People's 
        Republic of China. An April 2021 Wall Street Journal report 
        noted that the Chinese government and Chinese state-owned 
        enterprises are major purchasers of ads on the U.S.'s largest 
        social media platform, including to advance Chinese propaganda.

 I think, as Representative Maloney had said, New York City 
lost over 23,000 lives to COVID-19. And my district was among 
the hardest hit nationally. And I can tell you from firsthand 
experience, that the broader social and economic toll of COVID-
19 will be felt for generations.
    This is why it is all the more enraging to learn yesterday 
that President Trump and his Administration were not only 
incompetent in their mismanagement of the crisis but 
deliberately misleading the public and purposely making the job 
of Governors and local officials more difficult by willfully 
spreading misinformation about COVID-19 as far back as early 
February.
    These lies and this incompetence has costs tens of 
thousands of lives, hospitalized many times more, and has 
disrupted millions of families through a loss of a loved one, 
job losses, and financial hardship.


",Condemning Deliberate Misinformation Amidst COVID-19 Crisis,"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Representative Maloney highlights the devastating toll the virus has taken on New York City, with over 23,000 lives lost. The broader social and economic impacts are expected to reverberate for generations. However, recent revelations about deliberate misinformation spread by President Trump and his Administration have exacerbated the crisis. These actions, characterized as both incompetent and deceitful, have not only cost tens of thousands of lives but have also created significant challenges for governors and local officials. The deliberate spread of misinformation since early February has led to widespread confusion, hospitalizations, job losses, and financial hardship for millions of families."

 We didn't politicize the funding of public health in the 
United States at the budget that in fact made critical cuts, 
which we restored. We aren't the ones that call the alarm being 
raised about this pandemic. That is fake news. That came out of 
the President of the United States mouth and no gas lighting is 
going to hide that.
    And politicization, when the President of the United States 
finally did go down the CDC with you, Dr. Redfield, we appeared 
wearing this hat. A campaign hat in the middle of a crisis. We 
will not be lectured about politicization and all of your words 
and sanctimony will not cover up the fact that this 
Administration was not prepared for this crisis and it put 
lives at risk, American lives at risk.
    We didn't have the test we needed. We didn't have a 
diagnostics we needed. The President made patently false 
assertions, which Dr. Fauci corrected, about the development of 
the virus. In fact, he was more concerned about what was 
happening on the stock market than he seemed to be concerned 
about American public health. That is shameful and you can't 
cover that up.


 But Congress came together to pass a very important Corona 
supplemental that I think everyone would agree is making a huge 
difference in America's defense against the Coronavirus 
outbreak. But I have been very disappointed to hear some of the 
comments by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
Chairwoman Maloney mentioned the political spin. Mr. Connolly 
mentioned the politicization and fake news.


 So, I think the President should get a lot of credit for 
making that decision. But I want to focus on some things that 
are important to people in Kentucky because there is a lot of 
concern, there is a lot of misinformation. So, my simple 
question would be to anyone on the panel, which are the best 
website for concerned Americans to get onto that have factual 
information and important tips on how average everyday 
Americans can prepare for this?
    Dr. Fauci. So, there are two. One is, the core one is 
cdc.gov. And within that is Coronavirus.gov. But cdc.gov will 
ultimately get you very quickly to anywhere you want to go.
    Mr. Comer. So, my next question to anyone on the paddle, in 
the era of fake news and social media, how can Americans ensure 
that the information that they are sharing on the social media 
is accurate information? Is there--do you have any advice on 
that?
    Dr. Fauci. Yes, I think for the most part, at least from my 
experience, social media can often be as detrimental as it is 
helpful. That's the reason why, sir, I think the first question 
that you asked would be, one to go to the source of that data 
CDC--and I am not CDC, but I am saying CDC is a data-driven 
organization. And if you really want the facts and the data, I 
would just go to cdc.gov.


  Mr. Raskin. Thank you. Dr. Fauci, we have got two enemies 
in this crisis, one is the virus and one is he misinformation 
about the virus. And I want to quickly clear up a few things 
that have been said over the course of this process. One was by 
the President in early February when he said it looks like by 
April, you know, in theory when it gets a little warmer, it 
miraculously goes away. Is there any scientific reason to 
believe that?
    Dr. Fauci. The basis for any surmising that that might 
happen is based on what we see every year with influenza, which 
actually as you get to March and April and May, it actually 
goes way down, and other non-Novel Coronavirus, but common cold 
Coronaviruses often do that.


  Finally, let me close with this, this Committee sent you a 
request for information a week ago. We asked for basic 
information about the crisis and your plans for the response, 
but you have not provided us with anything. We understand that 
you are incredibly busy but a lot of this information should be 
at your fingertips.
    We need this information because we keep getting sometimes 
misinformation from the White House and we have an independent 
obligation to the American people. So, I have one last 
question, will you commit to producing the information we 
requested at least regarding testing, Dr. Fauci?
    Dr. Fauci. Madam Chairperson, I am not sure what 
information referring to that we did not provide. Are you 
talking about the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases?
    Chairwoman Maloney. We sent a letter with all the 
Subcommittee chairs and myself requesting information to every 
Department, yours, the CDC, FDA.
    Dr. Fauci. I will check this immediately after to find out 
what the issue is.


 My district is home to nearly 32 percent foreign-born 
residents with more than a quarter immigrating from Asia. This 
painful rhetoric has consequences. Restaurants across Boston's 
Chinatown have seen up to an 80 percent drop in business and I 
believe this has everything to do with the rapid spread of 
misinformation and paranoia.
    It is critical that we stand against these inciteful 
messages and assuage fear in our communities, and we do that by 
dispelling untruths and misinformation. We can only do that by 
sharing the facts and that is why I am grateful to have you 
here today so that we can get to the truth about this virus.


 Ms. Haaland. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Redfield. Thank you.
    I want to turn our attention--I think you have mentioned--
you know, all of you have mentioned several times today that 
big crowds need to be avoided. Is that correct?
    And I want--first of all, I want to just talk about our 
president for a moment. On March 8, he tweeted that fake news 
media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. On 
February 28, he called the coronavirus a Democratic hoax in 
the--in front of a huge rally, which was on national TV.",Confronting Misinformation and Political Rhetoric Amid the COVID-19 Crisis,"Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, politicians address the issue of misinformation and political spin surrounding the crisis. Critics argue that the administration's response to the pandemic was marred by false assertions and a lack of preparation. Additionally, there's a discussion about the importance of accurate information dissemination, with emphasis on trusted sources like the CDC's website. Lawmakers express concern about the spread of misinformation on social media and call for reliance on credible sources. Dr. Fauci emphasizes the need for factual information and cautions against misinformation on social media platforms. Furthermore, there's criticism about the administration's failure to provide requested information to Congress. The impact of misinformation on communities, particularly Asian communities, is highlighted, with a focus on dispelling falsehoods to alleviate fear and promote understanding of the virus."

My name is Lahoma Sue Parton. I am a member of the Kiowa 
Tribe of Oklahoma. I am president of the Federation of Indian 
Service Employees, affiliated with the American Federation of 
Teachers. FISE represents 6,700 employees at 350 work sites in 
22 states run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Bureau of 
Indian Education, the Office of Special Trustee for American 
Indians, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Indian 
Affairs under the Department of the Interior.
    The coronavirus has hit Native American communities 
especially hard, and misinformation or no information has 
complicated the lives and careers of our members.
    On March 16 and 17, all Bureau-operated schools were shut 
down and boarding schools were directed to send students home, 
but employees were directed to continue to report for duty.
    Employees were eventually directed to shelter in place and 
initially placed on weather safety leave. They were ultimately 
directed to telework, yet they were not provided with training 
nor equipment to telework. Many lived in rural areas with 
little or no broadband or internet access.


FISE represents 2,817 BIE bargaining unit employees who work at 55 
bureau-operated schools and offices located in 10 different states. 
Currently, 2,281 of our members work in schools located in Arizona and 
New Mexico. The coronavirus has hit Native American communities 
especially hard, particularly in how it has affected BIE-operated

management has complicated the lives and careers of our members.
	 Although I became aware in January, through news reports, of COVID-
19's devastating impact on a Washington state nursing home, I was not 
yet aware of its potential to become a pandemic that would affect us 
all. It was not I received an email at the end of January from the AFT, 
with guidance and resources regarding preparing for and taking 
precautions against a possible airborne viral pandemic, that I realized 
the implications of the coronavirus. About the same time, I received 
inquiries from some OST members who had questions as to why they were 
being advised to take home their laptop computers, just in case.





",Advocating for Indigenous Workers Amid the Pandemic,"Lahoma Sue Parton, president of the Federation of Indian Service Employees (FISE), representing 6,700 workers in Native American communities, highlights the challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. With a focus on Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) employees, Parton discusses the lack of information and support provided to workers, especially regarding telework in rural areas with limited internet access. She emphasizes the disproportionate impact on Native American communities and the need for better communication and resources to protect employees' health and safety."

In my opinion, engaging in ongoing climate denial efforts, 
in clear contradiction of decades of scientific evidence, is on 
par with the current administration's efforts to shrink 
responsibility for over 155,000 Americans who have lost their 
lives as a result of widespread misinformation and a distrust 
and disregard for science by leaders of this country.


 So, for example, we often hear about the heat waves in 
France in 2003, which resulted in many additional deaths. But 
what people forget to notice is that, in 2006, the French 
Government, in response to those heat wave deaths, took actions 
that ended up reducing the estimated death toll by 4,000.
    So, this idea that we are helpless to respond to these 
effects I think is false and creates a sense of helplessness 
among people that contributes to the rising anxiety and 
depression.



    Mr. Massie. Does a cow that eats corn produce more methane 
or less methane than one that eats grass?
    Mr. Shindell. It is not a very large difference.
    Mr. Massie. That wasn't my question. Which produces more?
    Mr. Shindell. I'm not positive of that. To my mind, they 
are about the same.
    Mr. Massie. Then how can you make a statement that cattle, 
domestic cattle, produce more methane than the buffalo did 
before we got here? Because that statement is false.
    Mr. Shindell. No, because buffalo are not the same animals 
as cows. Those are different species, and that's what I was 
getting at. Different species emit different amounts of methane 
per head.


There's a very--there's a lot of good news, there's a lot 
of--there's a very positive future. This idea that we need to 
go terrify school children in order to reduce air pollution, or 
the claims that somehow these reductions in air pollution 
occurred because we scared people or we engaged in this kind of 
alarmism, is just false. We did so because we actually believed 
in progress.
    So, that's the heart of the move against nuclear, and I see 
it in this climate discourse. It's inaccurate, it's 
exaggerated, and in many cases I think it's quite extreme. And 
a positive, pro-nuclear future, I think, points to ways in 
which we can achieve both human flourishing and environmental 
progress.

Then the last point I want to make is creating this false 
narrative of renewables versus nuclear. It's a strange way to 
approach the problem, I think, especially when the United 
States has had such a successful history in other energy and 
pollution areas of just leveling the playing field between 
energy sources.


  Mr. Raskin. OK. You know, we live in an age of a lot of 
disinformation and propaganda and mythology. I mean, you think 
about COVID-19, this terrible disease which has now afflicted 
more than 4 million Americans and killed 156,000 Americans. 
Still, we have heard and been invited to believe by high 
government sources that children are basically immune to the 
disease, which they're not, that COVID-19 is a hoax, which 
obviously it's not, that it can be cured with 
hydroxychloroquine when the medical authorities and the FDA say 
that that's not true, and that ingesting disinfectant can be a 
cure to the disease, which it definitely isn't.
    What about the propaganda and disinformation about climate 
change, has that been a hindrance to our ability to address the 
problem in a bipartisan or multipartisan or nonpartisan way?
    Chairwoman Maloney. The gentleman's time has expired.
    You may answer his question.
    Mr. Shindell. Thank you, Chairwoman.
    I would say that, yes, that has been a distraction, that it 
has made it harder to achieve progress, it has made it harder 
to put the actual cost of using fossil fuels into our economic 
system, what my colleague Dr. Greenstone has been discussing, 
the social cost, namely that we should level the playing field 
and we should account for the real cost of burning fossil fuels 
that cause both climate change and air pollution, and then we 
can let the market decide.
    It's already shifting in the direction we want, but it 
would be shifting faster without the misinformation and the 
failure to account for the real cost of using fossil fuels.


 Mr. Shellenberger. Yes, I mean, I would just--I think that 
the concern raised about misinformation comes from folks that 
are also conflating extreme weather and disasters.
    So, IPCC and every dictionary I've seen defines disasters 
as deaths from extreme weather and property damage. Deaths from 
natural disasters are going down around the world. They've been 
going down 90 percent. It's just wonderful. We should celebrate 
it. Fewer of our loved ones are being swept away in floods and 
hurricanes. All of the increase in property damage is due to 
the fact that we've become wealthier.
    So, the idea that people can see climate change in natural 
disasters is completely fallacious. That's not science. That's 
misinformation. Yes, we are able to detect in some extreme 
weather events a climate signal, but it takes very careful 
attribution studies.
    This effort to mislead people--and, you know, this 
citation, oh, it's hot in Washington, DC, I see both sides of 
the aisle. Some people say, ``Oh, it snowed, therefore there's 
no global warming.'' Other people say, ``It's hot out. That's 
proof of climate change.'' That's all fallacious, completely 
pseudoscientific, should just be considered--that should not be 
done. I mean, it's just grossly misleading.

I will also take the opportunity of your comment to speak 
about my great concern around digital authoritarianism and the 
export of it by the Chinese government.
    They are masters at blocking sites. They are masters at 
filtering what information arrives at what person. They are 
masters at flooding the network with misinformation, and they 
are also masters of co-opting social media.
    It is a significant concern. I don't believe it's a concern 
that we in the national security community have addressed so 
far, and it's something that I would really like us to spend a 
lot more time and thinking on so that we can figure ways of 
countering it. Thank you, sir.",Combatting Digital Authoritarianism: Addressing Chinese Government's Tactics,"The speaker expresses grave concern over the phenomenon of digital authoritarianism perpetuated by the Chinese government.

 Mr. Restrepo. Yes. The other thing that I think is--that is 
important here, is how we communicate and how dis- and 
misinformation play a role here. Because a lot of this kind of 
organizing in the migratory flow and in the migratory system is 
done through social media and is done through, quite frankly, 
smugglers who create mis- and disinformation to create kind-of 
the impression that things are different than they are at the 
U.S.-Mexico border. I think that is very much the case right 
now and has been in the last few months. So, this communication 
that matters is taking place in channels that I think sometimes 
as a Government, we don't really understand as well, or 
certainly don't really have the built-in capacity to 
communicate through.
    The last point, and leave it to my fellow panelists, a lot 
of this communication actually doesn't even take place in 
Spanish. Which is another one of those things we need to get 
into our head. It takes place in indigenous languages. Because 
a lot of the folks who are on the move, particularly in a 
country like Guatemala that is so fundamentally divided on 
racial grounds, on ethic grounds. The most vulnerable 
populations are the most marginalized and those are indigenous 
communities and they are being communicated to in indigenous 
languages and being misinformed in indigenous languages by 
folks who are preying on them and preying on their desperate 
situation. I think that is something we all need to think more 
about how we counteract that kind of information flow.",Addressing Disinformation in Migration Flows,"The use of disinformation and misinformation, particularly through social media and smugglers, significantly impacts migration flows and perceptions at the U.S.-Mexico border. Smugglers exploit vulnerable populations, especially indigenous communities, by disseminating false information in indigenous languages to mislead migrants. This communication challenge underscores the need for enhanced governmental understanding and capacity to effectively counteract misinformation channels used in migrant organizing. Recognizing the multilingual and diverse nature of this communication is crucial in developing strategies to combat disinformation and support vulnerable migrant populations."

  The lesson we should take from Syria, where Russia has now 
established itself as the key power broker for the region, is 
that where the U.S. disengages, Moscow steps in to fill the 
void. In Africa, the Kremlin is positioning itself to do the 
same. Thanks to the Congress and the work of this committee 
especially, since 2017, the U.S. has invested in both military 
and nonmilitary deterrence and containment measures, with a 
renewed commitment to the European Deterrence Initiative, EDI, 
support for counter disinformation efforts via the U.S. State 
Department and the Global Engagement Center, and a new and 
assertive cyber strategy. The 2020 NDAA [National Defense 
Authorization Act], in particular, took important steps to 
counter Russian malign activities in the non-kinetic domain. 
But there are places where we still need to do more.
    The U.S. should support Europe's efforts to do more for its 
own defense, and particularly the EDF [European Defence Fund] 
fund and PESCO [Permanent Structured Cooperation], and to 
ensure that these efforts are complementary and not duplicative 
of NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] efforts in the 
European space. The U.S. should continue to strengthen its 
efforts to counter Russian political warfare of which 
information operations are only part of the toolbox. It also 
includes cyber operations, influence through organized crime, 
bribery, subversion, and PSYOPS, or psychological operations.


 With your experience in Russia disinformation and work at 
the Atlantic Council, Dr. Polyakova, can you tell us the 
importance of this and how these contradictions and lack of 
resolve sometimes can really drastically and profoundly 
undercut our effort with our most important allies, which is 
what we are talking about here today?
    Dr. Polyakova. Thank you, Congressman. I would agree with 
you on the point that the administration has been sending very 
mixed messages to our allies in Europe. On the one hand, we 
have increased to a great degree our support for EDI, which I 
think has been a very good thing. Also, the Baltic Reassurance 
Initiative proposal, which is on the floor of this House, and 
the increase in rotational forces in Poland. So the security 
defense issue----
    Mr. Keating. That is fine. I want you to deal with the 
other issues. I want you to deal with actions like the phone 
call, asking President Zelensky to investigate his own country. 
I want to ask you about what message that sends to our allies 
and to Russia when Lavrov is here in the shadow of those peace 
talks and we still haven't had President Zelensky to the White 
House for an official visit.
    Dr. Polyakova. Well, my concern is that the message being 
received is that U.S. support for Ukraine is more tenuous than 
it actually needs to be and should be to deter further Russian 
aggression in that country. For that reason, I think it is 
important, especially for the United States Congress, to take a 
strong stand and reassure Ukraine through the Stand with 
Ukraine Act, which was passed some years ago in both Houses of 
Congress.


 Dr. Polyakova. I think our guiding strategy has to be to 
promote democratic values and principles across the world 
because no two democracies have ever gone to war with each 
other. And I don't think we as a society have direct experience 
of what it is like to shed blood and treasure for those values 
and principles, and we are losing that connection.
    And one of the narratives and the ideological battles in 
which Russia and China are involved in is to try to have a 
false equivalence narrative, that an authoritarian strongman 
society is the same as a democratic society. And that is false, 
and we have to work actively to dispel these kinds of 
disinformation narratives.


Ms. Torres Small. And could you expand a little bit upon 
some of the most challenging ways that they are doing that?
    Dr. Polyakova. Again, I think the Russian model is more of 
a short-term, high-impact approach versus the Chinese model, 
which is more of a long-term but high impact in the long term 
approach. Russia is incredibly strapped for its own resources. 
Increasingly, we are seeing intensifying proxy warfare, whether 
that be through the use of disinformation campaigns in the 
digital space, which often are linked to the kinds of proxy 
military groups that we see operating on the ground there.


  Dr. Polyakova. Again, I can't speak to any classified 
sources of information. What we know from open source is in the 
malign influence space in the information environment, we are 
getting much better at understanding how the Russians carry out 
disinformation operations. And the social media companies are 
increasingly working more closely with public agencies to 
coordinate on information sharing but we need to do a lot more 
of that. I was very happy to see in the NDAA a specific call to 
establish a coordination center that would allow for more 
information sharing between the private sector and the United 
States Government. I think these kinds of efforts are 
absolutely critical.
    I think in the cyberspace is where we face some of the 
greatest challenges and threats. The Russians, through, again, 
proxy groups, but also through their military intelligence 
units and services, have aggressively stepped up their cyber 
capabilities on the offensive side. And we have just recently 
basically opened the door for CYBERCOM [U.S. Cyber Command] to 
explore offensive capabilities. I think we need much more of 
that. I think we need to think of an offensive posture and a 
defensive posture when it comes to cyber, especially because 
this is where I see the greatest threat in whatever kind of 
conflict we face in the future, whether it be a great power war 
that we are talking about, or another conflict of the nature we 
have seen in the past with various kinds of rogue states or 
terrorist organizations. But cyber will play an absolutely 
changing role, a dramatically changing role in the nature and 
outcome of those conflicts.

The President's Fiscal Year 2021 USAID request 
appropriately prioritizes funding to key policy priorities. 
This includes implementation of the Administration's Indo-
Pacific strategy; resources to counter malign activity and 
disinformation campaigns of China, Russia, and Iran; support 
for our allies and our partners in the Middle East; support for 
interim President Guaido and democracy in Venezuela as well as 
countries supporting Venezuelan refugees; prioritizes funding 
for the United States International Development Finance 
Corporation which provides a critical alternative to China's 
predatory lending to developing countries; and it also advances 
WGDP initiative to promote women's empowerment and economic 
opportunity, which I strongly support.


 With today's growing fiscal challenges, we must double our 
efforts to ensure that every dollar spent is strategic in 
advancing U.S. interests. So I look forward to hearing from how 
our assistance will be used to push back on China's malign 
influence and mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 and ensure 
continued U.S. leadership around the world.


 So is this the kind of person you want representing USAID 
and the American people? What message are we sending to USAID 
employees by allowing appointees like Merritt Corrigan who has 
referred to a ``homo-empire,'' and the ``false pretense of 
women's equality with men?'' Those are obviously troubling to 
us. I hope it is troubling to you and I hope that that is not 
allowed to continue.


 Mr. McCaul. Well, I want to thank you for that. And thank 
you for your service at the Department of Homeland Security. 
And also it is exactly what I wanted to hear, you know, I mean 
working together, coordinating together, there is a lot of 
overlap between these two entities, I think, and the more you 
can coordinate and work together, not just to provide foreign 
assistance and humanitarian, which is vitally important for the 
Nation and the world, but also in this very important foreign 
policy that we are embarking on to counter this malign behavior 
from the Chinese Communist Party.


You know, most in this hearing, I do not know how many are 
still watching online, but it seems most have left. But an 
argument that I have heard over and over, bipartisanly, is one 
of the most frustrating arguments that I hear coming off of 
Capitol Hill. It is bullshit. That is the best way that I can 
say it and this is the argument. That people come into this 
room and stand on this Hill and continually say, well, what do 
I say to the service member going overseas that we could have 
prevented it by sending some U.S. taxpayer dollars somewhere 
else? That is a false narrative. It is a false argument that it 
is either one or the other, either we send something over in 
terms of U.S. aid or the U.S. service member has to go 
somewhere else and fight. That is not the truth and it should 
not be put forward on this committee. It is one of the worst 
things that I hear over and over.
    Now I do not want to diminish the work that USAID does or 
the people that go out there and do it. They do some yeoman 
work, some outstanding work in some terrible places across the 
globe. But my colleague, Mr. Sherman, he posed the question 
early on. He said, what do we say to the service member who 
comes home injured, you know, saying that we could have 
prevented this by sending that food over or this over? We 
cannot allow that argument to continue. It is not true. It is a 
false argument.


 It is not to say that there are not good uses over there, 
but that cannot be the excuse because it is a false narrative. 
Here is a true narrative. Every time we send a dollar overseas 
somewhere else, we are taking a dollar that could have 
otherwise been spent here in the United States of America. So 
let's ask this question. Either we are in an outbreak and a 
pandemic or we are not. Either we are or we are not.


 And the argument is that we have to send it over to 
somebody else and then we are using our service members as this 
false narrative to say that is why it has to be done. I will 
repeat my statement in the beginning. That is bullshit. And I 
yield back.
    Mr. Engel. Mr. Connolly.
    Mr. Connolly. Thank you.
    I respect my friend from Florida's service. He talks about 
false narratives. He just presented one. The dollars going 
overseas are an opportunity cost because those are dollars not 
being invested in America and that has been proved false for 
decades. Dollars going overseas through effective programs are 
investments for America. They are investments in laying the 
groundwork for trade and investment. They are laying the 
groundwork for the creation of many kinds of new jobs for 
Americans. They are investments for expanding our economy. And 
as we are learning in COVID-19, we do not live on an island all 
alone. We are part of humanity. When something happens over 
there, it can affect us over here. Investing in health 
infrastructure globally protects Americans.


 Administrator Barsa, the Chinese Communist Party continues 
to disseminate dangerously inaccurate and misleading 
information about COVID-19 and its origins. How is USAID 
supporting programs to correct CCP falsehoods and ensure that 
our partners are basing pandemic response efforts on accurate 
information?
    Mr. Barsa. Certainly, Congresswoman, thank you for your 
question. As part of your question, the premise of your 
question is these falsehoods are being perpetrated by the 
Chinese Communist Party, so one of the best tools we have in 
this information is to counter with our own information, to 
expose the lies when they occur, to find and to highlight 
instances of faulty PPE, faulty information.


 Mr. Barsa. Well certainly one of the things I am very proud 
of at USAID is our efforts on countering malign, criminal 
influence, for example, which basically rests on four pillars 
to focus on democracy and rule of law, independent media, 
energy independence, and economic diversification. Through our 
efforts, we have been able to turn the tide on Russian 
disinformation, for example.
    For example, in Georgia, in April, Facebook credited 
USAID's local implementing partner for the removal of over 500 
pages, 100 Facebook accounts, and 120 groups which were created 
maliciously by the Kremlin to, you know, to sow false 
narratives. In Serbia, we built partners' skills in fact-
checking and debunking false narratives to expose Kremlin 
information, and I keep going on with other examples.
    So we are very proud of our efforts to bring light to 
efforts not just by the Kremlin, but by the Chinese Communist 
Party as well.
    Mr. Trone. Well if we do not use things like Radio Free 
Europe, we cannot get out the true facts and we do not have to 
spend all of our time debunking the bad facts.
    Let's talk a second about highlighting the importance of 
countering malign Kremlin influences throughout Europe and 
Eurasia, yet your budget request seriously reduces the capacity 
building and anti-corruption programs. So how is USAID going to 
counter these Russian maligned influences, and how would 
programming be impacted if these reductions are all enacted?
    Mr. Barsa. Certainly Congressman, as stated before, the 
budget you see before you is the product of a long process of 
difficult decisions about how to allocate scarce resources. So 
certainly our work in fighting corruption, not just in Europe

",Congressional Hearing on USAID Funding and Foreign Policy Priorities,"This excerpt is from a congressional hearing discussing the USAID budget for Fiscal Year 2021 and its alignment with U.S. foreign policy objectives. It highlights the allocation of funds to various priorities, including the Indo-Pacific strategy, countering malign activity from China, Russia, and Iran, supporting allies in the Middle East, and promoting women's empowerment through the WGDP initiative. Members of Congress express concerns about appointees' controversial statements within USAID and emphasize the importance of strategic spending to advance U.S. interests. The discussion also touches on the false narrative that foreign aid competes with domestic needs and addresses efforts to counter disinformation from foreign adversaries like the Chinese Communist Party and the Kremlin. Additionally, there's a debate on the effectiveness of USAID programs in countering Russian influence amid proposed budget reductions."

(2) Political influence operations.--The term ``political 
        influence operations'' means the coordinated and often 
        concealed application of disinformation, press manipulation, 
        economic coercion, targeted investments, corruption, or 
        academic censorship, which are often intended--
                    (A) to coerce and corrupt United States interests, 
                values, institutions, or individuals; and
                    (B) to foster attitudes, behavior, decisions, or 
                outcomes in the United States that support the 
                interests of the Government of the People's Republic of 
                China or the Chinese Communist Party.

 (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the political influence operations of the Government of 
        the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party 
        are not ``soft power'' intended to persuade, but ``sharp 
        power'' intended--
                    (A) to penetrate or corrupt democratic countries 
                and undermine democratic institutions and freedoms;
                    (B) to foster attitudes, behavior, laws, and 
                policies favorable to the Government of the People's 
                Republic of China's interest through disinformation, 
                coercion, corruption, and other means;
                    (C) to widen the scope of Chinese authoritarian 
                influence around the world, including--
                            (i) to suppress political opposition to the 
                        Chinese Communist Party; and
                            (ii) to violate the internationally 
                        recognized human and civil rights of both 
                        Chinese and foreign citizens living in 
                        countries around the world; and
                    (D) to undermine the strength of American alliances 
                around the world; and
            (2) the people of the United States need reliable and 
        current information--",Countering Chinese Political Influence Operations Act,"The Countering Chinese Political Influence Operations Act defines and addresses political influence operations conducted by the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party within the United States and globally. These operations encompass coordinated efforts involving disinformation, press manipulation, economic coercion, targeted investments, corruption, and academic censorship. The Act acknowledges that such operations are not mere ""soft power"" tactics but rather ""sharp power"" strategies aimed at penetrating or corrupting democratic countries, undermining democratic institutions, fostering attitudes and policies favorable to China's interests, expanding Chinese authoritarian influence worldwide, suppressing political opposition, violating human and civil rights, and weakening American alliances. It emphasizes the importance of providing reliable and up-to-date information to the American people regarding these influence operations."

Members will have questions for you, Mr. Secretary, about 
areas where additional resources will be necessary, such as 
homeland security grants to States and local governments and 
cybersecurity funding given the recent cyber attacks. Be 
assured we will be engaging the administration on these funding 
needs as the appropriations process moves forward. Beyond the 
budget, the committee looks forward to working with the 
Department on a range of pressing legislative and policy 
matters. For example, we look forward to working with the 
administration completing the nomination process for the 
Department and seeing competent, Senate-confirmed individuals 
leading DHS's components, agencies, and offices once again.


 On the cyber front, the budget requests a 29 percent 
increase for the Department of Energy cyber activities, but 
only a 6 percent increase for CISA. The Biden budget simply 
fails to reflect the priorities that are critical to the 
defense of the homeland. So, I do not envy you having to come 
before the committee and defend this request on behalf of the 
administration.
    I honestly just don't know how it is possible to spend that 
much money on a grab bag full of far-left proposals, while 
somehow neglecting to adequately defend the homeland. 
Particularly, given the rash of major cyber attacks we have had 
recently. Mr. Secretary, unfortunately since you were last 
before the committee, the crisis at the border has not gotten 
better. In fact, it is trending worse. Just last week, Customs 
and Border Protection announced that over 180,000 migrants were 
encountered along the Southwest Border in the month of May 
alone, including 121,000 single adults, over 44,600 family 
units, and over 14,000 unaccompanied minors.


 How can CISA be expected to continue to address these cyber 
threats head-on with such a small budget, given that the global 
financial impact of these cyber attacks amounts to over $1 
trillion annually? Try to digest that. Over $1 trillion 
annually is the cost of these cyber attacks and we are not 
really doing much about it with CISA.


The Biden budget simply fails to reflect the priorities that are 
critical to the defense of the homeland. And so, I do not envy you 
having to come before the committee and defend this request on behalf 
of the administration. I honestly just don't know how it is possible to 
spend that much money on a grab bag of far-left proposals, while 
somehow neglecting to adequately defend the homeland particularly given 
the rash of major cyber attacks we have seen recently.


 Unfortunately, ransomware attacks are becoming a more pervasive 
threat, and I feel that we, as a country continue to fall further and 
further behind--we continue to play defense instead of being on 
offense. I am concerned that the President's budget included a sharper 
increase for other Federal cybersecurity efforts, but not CISA, 
especially given the attacks CISA is tasked to defend. How can CISA be 
expected to continue to address these cyber threats head-on with such a 
small budget given that the global financial impact of these cyber 
attacks amounts to over $1 trillion annually?


In recognition of the growing threat of cyber attacks 
against both the public and private sectors, the President is 
requesting new resources for the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency which leads DHS in interagency 
efforts to defend against today's threats and promote cyber 
resilience. It provides $2.1 billion for cyber activities, 
which builds on the $650 million already provided to CISA in 
the American Rescue Plan to respond to Government-wide breaches 
and boost cyber defenses. It will also allow CISA to enhance 
its cybersecurity tools, hire qualified experts, and obtain 
support services to protect and defend critical infrastructure 
and Federal information technology systems.


Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Katko, and distinguished Members 
of the committee: It is a privilege to appear before you today to 
discuss the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) fiscal year 2022 
budget.
    On a daily basis, the more than 240,000 men and women of DHS 
respond to our Nation's most serious threats. DHS employees rise to 
every challenge, and the challenges are many. DHS is aggressively 
pursuing the administration's priorities and addressing some of the 
most critical and evolving threats to the United States. We are 
focusing on defeating the COVID-19 pandemic, advancing technology for 
border security while promoting a humane and efficient immigration 
system, combatting Domestic Violent Extremism, and detecting, 
mitigating, recovering from, and responding to malicious cyber attacks. 
I would like to highlight the work we have undertaken so far at DHS 
under the Biden-Harris administration, as well as the priorities 
included in the fiscal year 2022 President's budget.


stopping the threat of domestic violent extremism
    As threats against the Nation evolve, it is critical that the 
Department adapts quickly and efficiently when necessary to meet any 
threat against the people of the United States. Domestic Violent 
Extremism (DVE) is typically fueled by false narratives, conspiracy 
theories, and extremist rhetoric spread through social media and other 
on-line platforms. The lethality of this threat is all too real, as 
witnessed during the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, and 
recent attacks across the United States, including against Government 
buildings, personnel, and minority groups. DHS is prioritizing 
addressing this threat while improving the quality of our intelligence 
gathering and analysis, information sharing, and DVE detection, 
prevention, and response efforts.


 Secretary Mayorkas. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. We 
have, indeed, reviewed the events that led up to the tragic 
events of January 6, and our review is on-going. I think that 
we are predicated on 3 pillars of our work to combat domestic 
terrorism.
    No. 1, we base it on intelligence and information gathered 
by law enforcement. We are data-driven. No. 2, we are focused 
on ensuring that while we do this critical work, we protect 
civil rights, civil liberties, and the rights of privacy of 
each member of the American public. Third, and importantly, 
that we are ideology-neutral, that we look at any ideology, of 
false narrative, of mis- and disinformation with respect to 
ideologies of hate and radicalization, and critically, and this 
is what is a distinguishing factor, their connectivity to 
violence, regardless of the politics of any ideology, and that 
we address it. This has been a long-standing challenge and I 
note, for example, the 2017 attack on Republican Members of 
Congress at our baseball stadium. It is vitally important that 
we keep that principle in mind that we are ideology-neutral and 
we are focused on the connectivity to violence, which is 
unacceptable in our country.


 Let me turn to CISA and the important work of cyber and 
cyber response. We are under attack. The President made it 
clear in his meeting with Mr. Putin yesterday. I want to ask, 
how is the Cyber Response Recovery Fund designed to function in 
consort with CISA in order to both prevent and respond to 
attacks on our critical infrastructure such as in the case with 
Solar Winds and Colonial Pipeline? Mr. Secretary, as you well 
know, my time is short and I have several other questions. I am 
delighted to welcome you.
    Secretary Mayorkas. Congresswoman, thank you so much for 
your support of CISA and its critical mission. That fund is 
very important to equip and enable victims of cyber attacks to 
recover from those attacks most swiftly in the service of the 
public-private partnership and the American public.


Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, I am not in a position to 
editorialize on actions of the--or inactions of the prior 
administration. I am focused on lessons learned and what we can 
do to make sure that our responsibilities are fulfilled. In 
fact, we have taken significant steps in that regard. We issued 
the first NTAS Bulletin in January. The first in quite some 
time. Since then, we have issued information bulletins to 
State, local, Tribal, and territorial partners with respect to 
the false narratives that we are observing on social media to 
make sure that the horrific events of January 6 do not happen 
again.


 Ms. Slotkin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Mayorkas, 
thank you for joining us today. I am struck as we head to the 
20th anniversary of 9/11 just how different the homeland issues 
are from when, you know, DHS was stood up. Where most Americans 
were, you know, worried about threats from foreign actors, from 
foreign terrorists and attacks on the homeland. Fast-forward 20 
years, we are talking about cyber attacks, the border, domestic 
terrorism. It is very different.
    So, what I want to ask is about those pivots to those very 
different things that are threatening Americans. Particularly 
on cyber, I would just note it feels like all roads lead back 
to the Department of Homeland Security, particularly in the 
last couple of weeks. First, because these attacks have really 
started to affect the average American. They are affecting our, 
you know, gas, and our meat, and our video games. I am, you 
know, standing with farmers and they are asking me about 
cybersecurity. You all at CISA are really the 9-1-1. You are 
the 9-1-1 call center for cyber attacks on our businesses, on 
our local governments. It is critical that you be well-funded 
and well-staffed and ready to take on that responsibility.


  Second, yesterday in the summit between President Biden and 
President Putin, you know, one of the big things where the 
President put down a marker was on this list of 16 different 
critical infrastructure sectors and how it was important that 
the Russians understood that those sectors meant something to 
us. So, I guess my first question is can you please tell us how 
you and CISA are prepared to take on this additional 
responsibility? Particularly since, yes, you know, when it 
comes to deterring Russian cyber attacks, Chinese cyber 
attacks, often resilience is the best way to deter future 
attacks. So, tell me about CISA. We are waiting for your 
questions, your concerns, your asks on money and resources. 
Tell us what you have done to prepare.


 Ms. Clarke. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is good to see 
you again, Secretary Mayorkas. I applaud your decision earlier 
this year to require State Homeland Security Program and Urban 
Area Security initiative grantees to dedicate at least 7.5 
percent of their award to enhancing their cybersecurity 
posture. I also understand that the administration is seeking 
funding for a cyber response and recovery fund. While I support 
these efforts to provide State and local governments additional 
resources, I believe we get more bang for our buck investing in 
efforts to prevent malicious actors from compromising networks 
in the first place.
    The ever-increasing number of ransomware attacks has 
demonstrated that additional support is needed going forward. 
For that reason, this committee recently passed my legislation, 
the State and Local Cyber Security Improvement Act, which would 
authorize $500 million in annual cybersecurity grants to State, 
local, Tribal, and territorial governments. Do you agree that 
the vulnerability of our State and local governments to cyber 
attacks is a National security threat? That the Federal 
Government should provide a dedicated grant program to 
strengthen State and local cybersecurity?
    Secretary Mayorkas. Congresswoman, thank you for 
championing this effort. I do agree that the cyber 
vulnerability of State and local governments is a Homeland 
Security issue across our Nation. I look forward to working 
with you to see how we can best empower and equip and resource 
State and local governments, especially those that don't have 
the education and resources to strengthen their cybersecurity 
alone.
	 Ms. Clarke. I look forward to working with you as well, Mr. 
Secretary. As the Chairwoman of the cybersecurity committee, I 
am extremely concerned about the rise in ransomware and other 
cyber attacks targeting our critical infrastructure. I am 
concerned that we seem to be--to keep relearning the same 
lessons from each other--each of these attacks. We have asked 
CISA to do an enormous job, but we have given them next to no 
regulatory authority over privately-owned critical 
infrastructure. Nor do they have sustained visibility into 
threats on private networks.
    I am working on legislation to close both of those gaps. 
First, by requiring critical infrastructure owners and 
operators to report cyber incidents to CISA. Second, by 
authorizing capabilities CISA has brought--has built through a 
pilot called Cyber Sentry which allows CISA to partner with 
certain strategically-placed critical infrastructure to monitor 
and detect threats in real time. Specifically, threats to 
industrial control systems and operational technology. Would 
you agree that for CISA to be effective, it needs access to 
information about cyber attacks and greater visibility around 
those threats to privately-owned critical infrastructure?
    Secretary Mayorkas. I think, Congresswoman, once again, 
thank you. I do believe that CISA's visibility into what is 
happening across the country is critical to securing our 
homeland against cyber attacks. It is why the public-private 
information-sharing architecture is central to its strategy.


 Miss Rice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Mayorkas, I 
was pleased this week to see the White House release the first-
ever National Strategy for Domestic Terrorism and that the 
strategy places a particular emphasis on addressing the racism, 
bigotry, and religious hatred that has fueled a great deal of 
domestic violent extremism. Even before the pandemic, 
communities in my district and across New York were reeling 
from a spate of anti-Semitic attacks. Things have only worsened 
as extremists and conspiracy theorists spin lies about Jews 
spreading the virus or controlling our elections.


  Mr. Garbarino. I appreciate that and I agree with the 
Ranking Member that CISA needs to be a much highly--much more 
funded organization and needs to be really the centerpiece of 
the Government's cybersecurity. Which is why I am wondering 
where is the administration--I know they are currently 
reviewing and providing comments on some cybersecurity bills 
that would give the Department of Energy enhanced cybersecurity 
authorities relating to the energy and pipeline sectors. It is 
not just the pipeline and energy sectors that is under attack 
from these cyber attacks. So, wouldn't it make more sense for 
CISA to have the responsibility across the board to be the 
quarterback and not give DOE enhanced cybersecurity authorities 
over these pipelines because, you know, these attacks are not 
sector-specific?
    Secretary Mayorkas. So, we have been taking a look at that 
question. I think the question raises very complex issues that 
we also would look forward to discussing. I think what we have 
done in the pipeline arena in the pipeline sector in response 
to the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack speaks of the 
complexity of the issues. TSA as assuredly you know, regulates 
the security of the gas pipelines. In coordination with CISA, 
issued a new security directive several weeks ago, which 
required--imposed certain obligations on gas pipeline operators 
such as identifying the cybersecurity coordinator who would be 
on call 24/7. Such as providing information to CISA upon an 
attack. I think this is a very complex area with respect to the 
role of CISA vis-a-vis regulatory agencies across the different 
sectors. I would look forward to discussing that with you, 
Congressman Garbarino.


 Mr. Torres. OK. As you know, Mr. Secretary, there has been 
a surge in cyber attacks. The law department in America's 
largest city was struck by a cyber attack. So was the 
Metropolitan Transit Authority, the largest public transit 
system in the United States. Are you aware of each of these 
attacks?
    Secretary Mayorkas. I am.
    Mr. Torres. Since local and State governments and public 
transit systems have no reporting obligation to DHS when it 
comes to cyber incidents, how did you find out about these 
attacks? When did you find out? Did you find out immediately?
    Secretary Mayorkas. Congressman, we pride ourselves in our 
partnerships with both public agencies across the Nation as 
well as with the private sector. We are looking at reporting 
obligations. The current architecture, they are voluntary. We 
are determining the pros and cons of making reporting 
obligations mandatory. I should say, obliging them. There are 
both----
	 Mr. Torres. Just in the interest of time quickly, Mr. 
Secretary, I just want to--because my time is running out. Does 
DHS have the authority to require reporting of cyber incidents 
as a condition for receiving DHS grants?
    Secretary Mayorkas. I would have to take a look at that 
precise question as you tie it to grant funding, Congressman.
    Mr. Torres. Stipulate for a moment that you did have the 
authority, would you be open to extending reporting obligations 
to State and local governments and public transit systems that 
become the target of cyber attacks?
    Secretary Mayorkas. I would like to analyze that issue 
better. I am not equipped to answer such a significant question 
extemporaneously.



The Honorable Bennie G. Thompson,
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, U.S. House of 
        Representatives, Washington, DC 20515.
    Chair Thompson: I am writing to you regarding a false allegation 
being made about me which states that I requested and received 
protection from the United States Capitol Police, the United States 
Secret Service, and the Federal Air Marshal Service during an April 17, 
2021 flight from Washington Dulles International Airport to 
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. This false allegation is 
being circulated by several media outlets and is claiming that Members 
of Congress are abusing the Federal Air Marshal Service due to changes 
made after January 6, 2021.
    To be clear, I did not request any protection from any of the 
agencies I have outlined. I have never requested Federal Air Marshal 
protection, Secret Service, or any armed guards from anywhere and I 
certainly never knew that Members of Congress have called or requested 
Air Marshal protection. It is my understanding that the Federal Air 
Marshal Service is a service overseen by the Transportation Security 
Administration and the Department of Homeland Security.
    Due to the nature of the false claim against myself and other 
Members of Congress regarding the Federal Air Marshal Service, I am 
doing my own thorough investigation. While I have received definitive 
statements from the United States Capitol Police and the United States 
Secret Service confirming that I did not request or receive protection 
from them, I am now requesting a definitive statement from the Federal 
Air Marshal Service clarifying that I did not request Air Marshals to 
accompany me on my April 17 flight, or any of my flights. Due to these 
false accusations, I have received threats against my life and I feel I 
must defend myself by having the agencies I am accused of using tell 
the truth about the allegations.
    Through my inquiries into this matter, it was determined by the 
U.S. Capitol Police that my itinerary for the April 17 flight was 
leaked by an individual with the Metropolitan Washington Airports 
Authority to right-wing media outlets who began pushing a false 
narrative about Members of Congress and their alleged abuse of the 
Federal Air Marshal Service. The identification of this person was not 
given, nor is it clear if any actions have been taken against them for 
the leak of my itinerary. I would like to know if there is any law that 
prohibits individuals from leaking the flight information of any 
passenger, be it an elected official or otherwise.

",Congressional Inquiry into False Allegations Regarding Federal Air Marshal Service,"Congressman Bennie G. Thompson, Chair of the Committee on Homeland Security, addresses false allegations circulating in the media about his purported use of Federal Air Marshal protection during a flight. He refutes these claims, stating he did not request nor receive such protection. Concerned about threats resulting from these allegations, Congressman Thompson seeks clarifications from the Federal Air Marshal Service to refute the accusations and investigate the source of the leaked itinerary, which fueled the false narrative in right-wing media outlets."

 So clearly, COVID-19 is having a disproportionate impact on 
minoritized and marginalized communities. And why? Structural 
inequities that result from long-term policies, practices, and 
procedures that determine access to comprehensive health care, 
as well as those determinants of health: inadequate housing, 
education, food insecurity.
    And these are all influenced by bias and racial 
discrimination; higher prevalence of chronic health conditions 
such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and obesity; an 
increased likelihood of working essential jobs such as bus 
drivers, train operators, those who are working in our 
supermarkets and meat packing plants, hospitals and nursing 
home--and, of course, that increases the risk of exposure; a 
stronger likelihood of living in congregate, multi-generational 
living arrangements; and major mistrusts of medical 
institutions because of historical abuses of science and 
research; and, of course, misinformation and disinformation.


 And third, you know, I think it is the misinformation, the 
disinformation that has been out there.


",Disproportionate Impact of COVID-19 on Marginalized Communities,"COVID-19 has disproportionately affected minoritized and marginalized communities due to structural inequities resulting from long-standing policies and practices. These inequities include limited access to comprehensive healthcare, inadequate housing, education, and food insecurity, all influenced by bias and racial discrimination. Factors contributing to the higher impact on these communities include a higher prevalence of chronic health conditions, working essential jobs with increased exposure risk, living in multi-generational arrangements, historical mistrust of medical institutions, and misinformation and disinformation. Addressing these issues is crucial to mitigating the impact of the pandemic on vulnerable populations."

 With the degradation of ISIS and al-Qaeda capability, the United 
States has now focused its budget and operational capabilities on near 
peer countries. We have witnessed foreign governments, and their 
sponsored proxies, conduct sophisticated cyber attacks against our 
critical infrastructure and commercial software supply chains. These 
countries, and their sponsored proxies, have also undertaken 
sophisticated information operations against the people of America. 
They have penetrated social media platforms and have exacerbated 
partisan issues with the sole intention of polarizing the American 
people and fomenting discontent in almost every aspect of our lives. 
These adversarial agents have created an environment where both the far 
left and far right are convinced of the other's intention to 
``overthrow'' Federal, State, and local governments, as well as 
undermine their respective affinity groups and institutions, whether 
that be social justice organizations or law enforcement.


 There is no clearer manifestation of the threat of domestic 
terrorism than the events that unfolded on January 6. The January 6 
assault on the Capitol demonstrated how unprepared we were for domestic 
terrorism fueled by extreme ideologies and misinformation. The attack 
offers lessons that are applicable to TSA and across the Department.
    The vast majority of domestic terrorists in recent memory have used 
the internet to consume and post their extremist views and connect with 
a network that shares their ideology. We must work to ensure that 
relevant intelligence information is properly shared, that the right 
resources are in place to allow for rapid incident response, and that 
lines of communication are effective.
    More effective utilization of open-source intelligence will 
increase our ability to circumvent a planned attack as well as study 
the on-line behavior of anyone that espouses hateful philosophies. We 
also need to do a better job of working with social media companies to 
detect and handle extremist content while also remaining cognizant of 
foreign actors that further spread disinformation through on-line 
platforms. We also need to empower the Department to work with fusion 
centers around the country on how to conduct thorough intelligence 
analysis. State and local agencies are our first line of defense 
against domestic extremists.


 TSA's mandate is not only to mitigate the threats of today but to 
preempt evolving threats as our adversaries continue to adapt and 
evolve their tactics and methods. In the 2000's, we witnessed hijackers 
using planes as weapons, and we saw unique methods in attempts to 
conceal explosives in items like shoes, underwear, and soft drinks. In 
the 2010's, we witnessed explosives hidden in electronics and attacks 
on the public side of the airport. Now, in the 2020's, we face new and 
extremely sophisticated threats from state and non-state actors, 
ranging from cyber attacks to concerns about hostile and non-hostile 
unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), in addition to traditional threats. 
From January 2018 through August 2021, there were 2,476 UAS events 
reported to TSA affecting all modes of transportation. From the 
beginning of 2021 through the end of August, there has been a 169 
percent increase in UAS sightings in the domestic aviation environment, 
requiring 31 aircraft evasive actions. We are not only focused on 
elaborate plots and large-scale attacks but also on current threats, 
which could come from domestic violent extremists as well as insiders. 
While the threat landscape has grown more complicated over the years, 
one thing has not changed--we still face ambitious adversaries who are 
intensely focused on finding a point of attack and waiting for 
opportunity.


 Finally, each day we hear about new cyber attacks, especially 
ransomware, impacting private businesses and governmental agencies 
globally. This spring's Colonial Pipeline attack caused panic buying 
across the southeast United States and, frankly, I think most Americans 
were surprised to learn that TSA has regulatory authority over that 
critical infrastructure. Congress and the administration must continue 
investing money, resources, and personnel, to ensure that key 
transportation systems, whether pipelines or much better known critical 
systems such as Secure Flight and FAA's Air Traffic Control systems, 
are secure 24/7.
    The women and men of TSA are dedicated to keeping travelers safe. 
Thanks for doing your part to ensure they have the tools, resources, 
and support to do this critical job properly. I'll be glad to take any 
questions you may have.


 Ms. Watson Coleman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you 
to each of our witnesses for this very informative discussion 
that we are having.
    Let me associate myself with your comments and the Ranking 
Member and every Member who has spoken out on behalf of the 
compensation and the recognition of the significance of our 
front-line workers here, our TSOs, and that they should have 
predictability, a pathway for a career. This would help us with 
the morale issues.
    I have--I think about the unique question. In the 21st 
Century you may not need a terrorist aboard a plane to hijack 
it. As planes, trains, subways, and buses become increasingly 
automated, we need to be prepared for when hijackers inevitably 
put lives at risk by launching a cyber attack against the 
operational or navigation systems of the transportation target. 
As we have seen in recent ransomware attacks, our adversaries 
consider no target off-limits.


 Mr. Garbarino. You had said--I know you had said before you 
are working with CEOs and CISOs of companies making sure that 
they are better prepared for these cyber attacks. Has that been 
receptive across pipeline owners and operators, as well as 
across the board, I guess?
    Mr. Pekoske. Yes, sir, very perceptive and actually very 
regular as well. To have, you know, we have regular 
opportunities to engage to make sure that we are all on track 
to get the cyber directives fully implemented and also look at 
other ways that we might provide better cybersecurity overall 
for the system. Additionally, any CEO knows that if they want 
to call and talk to me about anything, that is absolutely their 
privilege to do, and I would be happy to have those 
conversations.",TSA's Evolving Role in Combating Domestic Terrorism and Cyber Threats,"The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has adapted to address evolving threats, including cyber attacks, information operations, and domestic terrorism fueled by extreme ideologies and misinformation. With the degradation of ISIS and al-Qaeda, the U.S. has shifted resources to counter near-peer adversaries and their proxies who conduct cyber attacks on critical infrastructure and engage in information warfare to polarize American society. The January 6th assault on the Capitol highlighted the threat of domestic terrorism and the need for improved intelligence sharing, rapid incident response, and effective communication. TSA aims to preempt evolving threats by leveraging open-source intelligence, collaborating with social media companies, and empowering state and local agencies. The agency also faces new challenges, such as hostile unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and insider threats, in addition to traditional aviation security concerns. To address these threats, TSA works closely with pipeline owners, aircraft operators, and other stakeholders to enhance cybersecurity preparedness and resilience across the transportation sector."

SEC. 3. PROGRAM PRIORITIZATION AND DEMOCRACY STRATEGY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Democracy has weakened around the world for at least 15 
        consecutive years. In some places, authoritarian leaders have 
        deliberately chipped away at the pillars of democracy; in 
        others, rampant partisanship and disinformation have pitted 
        democratic electorates against themselves. In many places, the 
        People's Republic of China (PRC), the Federation of Russia, and 
        other states have found ways to encourage or amplify these 
        trends, including through the strategic use of corruption.
            (2) The erosion of global democracy fundamentally 
        undermines the national security of the United States. 
        Democracies consistently prove to be the most reliable 
        geopolitical allies and trading partners for the United States. 
        Democracies by any reasonable measure outperform non-
        democracies in delivering prosperity and good governance, and 
        in preventing instability and violent extremism. The erosion of 
        democracy in foreign countries threatens the United States at 
        home, because the threats democracy faces around the world 
        (including disinformation, hyperpolarization, election 
        meddling, weaponized corruption, digital repression, and 
        attacks on independent media) respect no national boundary. If 
        left unaddressed overseas, this democratic erosion will 
        threaten American democracy at home.
            (3) More generally, the competition between democracies and 
        autocracies has again become an animating feature of global 
        politics, with authoritarian powers (often with support from 
        the PRC or Russia) using their resources, influence, and 
        technology to undermine and interfere in democratic processes 
        and co-opt public officials.
            (4) The current approach of the United States Government to 
        supporting global democracy must be updated to meet today's 
        challenges. The survival of the democratic project will always 
        depend on free and fair elections, strong democratic 
        institutions, the rule of law, and an empowered civil society. 
        The United States Government must also establish new 
        authorities and resources to address contemporary threats to 
        democracy, including malign foreign interference, transnational 
        corruption, and digital authoritarianism.
    (b) Program Prioritization.--The United States Government should 
prioritize democracy programs that--
            (1) advance democracy worldwide, including during a 
        country's transition to democracy, a consolidation of democracy 
        following such a transition, and democratic backsliding in a 
        country;
            (2) support democracy and democratic activists in closed 
        and repressive societies, including defending their human 
        rights;
            (3) counter the malign influence of the PRC, the Federation 
        of Russia, and other authoritarian governments;
            (4) counter corruption and kleptocracy, including by 
        enhancing transparent, accountable, and responsive governance;
            (5) promote and protect independent media, civil society 
        activists, writers, artists, and intellectuals;
            (6) counter misinformation and disinformation of all kinds, 
        but especially in the digital domain;

 (D) center democratic values and human rights in 
                current and emerging technologies, and counter efforts 
                by authoritarian governments to surveil, censor, or 
                otherwise repress populations by digital means, 
                including through programs that--
                            (i) counter disinformation;
                            (ii) establish an initiative to be housed 
                        at USAID to help countries around the world 
                        implement governing regulations for the 
                        procurement and use of technology consistent 
                        with democratic and human rights norms and 
                        standards;
                            (iii) provide ``digital public goods'' to 
                        reduce the appeal of authoritarian-leaning 
                        technologies to cash-strapped countries;
                            (iv) provide education on digital literacy 
                        to key populations; and
                            (v) support the ongoing prioritization of 
                        democratic values in technological development 
                        in the years to come; and
                    (E) establish an international coalition of 
                governmental and nongovernmental actors dedicated to 
                preserving election integrity by providing funds to 
                deter or combat external influence in elections abroad, 
                including cyber intrusion, disinformation, and other 
                threats, and assist elections to meet coalition-defined 
                standards of electoral integrity.",Strengthening Global Democracy Act,"The ""Strengthening Global Democracy Act"" addresses the weakening of democracy worldwide and the threats posed by authoritarian regimes to democratic processes.

Additionally, it emphasizes the need to combat corruption, protect independent media and civil society, and address challenges posed by emerging technologies. The act proposes initiatives to counter digital authoritarianism, establish democratic norms in technological development, and form international coalitions to preserve election integrity and combat external interference in elections abroad.

Chairman Himes. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
    We now welcome the testimony of our distinguished 
witnesses, and we have five witnesses today. First, Ms. Iman 
Boukadoum, who is a Senior Program Manager at The Leadership 
Conference on Civil and Human Rights; second, Ms. Lecia Brooks, 
who is Chief of Staff at the Southern Poverty Law Center; 
third, Mr. Daniel Glaser, who is Global Head of Jurisdictional 
Services and head of the Washington, D.C., office of K2 
Integrity, a Senior Advisor at the Foundation for Defense of 
Democracies, and a former Assistant Secretary for Terrorist 
Financing and Financial Crimes at the U.S. Department of the 
Treasury; fourth, Dr. Daniel Rogers, who is co-founder and 
chief technology officer of the Global Disinformation Index; 
and fifth, Dr. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, who is chief executive 
officer at Valens Global.


 Our testimony outlines how this movement finances itself in 
the decentralized way in which they now operate. The funding 
and financing of hate groups in this decentralized landscape is 
also changing in important ways. In the past, hate groups 
raised money by charging dues, selling products, or requiring 
the purchase of uniforms. Today, some White nationalist groups 
and personalities are raising funds through the distribution of 
propaganda itself.
    In November, SPLC researchers reported that dozens of 
extremist groups were earning thousands of dollars per month on 
a popular live-streaming platform called DLive. As the post-
election period became dominated by former President Trump's 
false assertions that the election was fraudulent, these DLive 
streamers shifted to video streaming at in-person events 
branded with the slogan, ``Stop the Steal.'' Some of these same 
individuals were featured by House impeachment managers as key 
perpetrators of the violence on January 6th. You see, they had 
used DLive to live-stream the events inside the Capitol and on 
the grounds.


 STATEMENT OF DANIEL ROGERS, CO-FOUNDER AND CHIEF TECHNOLOGY 
              OFFICER, GLOBAL DISINFORMATION INDEX

    Mr. Rogers. Chairman Himes, Ranking Member Hill, Chairwoman 
Waters, and members of the subcommittee, good morning, and 
thank for the opportunity to speak before you and discuss the 
funding mechanisms of these domestic violent extremist groups.
    I am the co-founder and chief technology officer of the 
Global Disinformation Index (GDI), a nonprofit focused on 
catalyzing change in the technology industry to disrupt online 
disinformation.
    Last fall, my colleague, Ben Decker, and our team at the 
GDI collaborated with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue to 
conduct a study entitled, ``Bankrolling Bigotry'', to examine 
the funding mechanisms of American hate groups.
    Many of the groups implicated in the events of January 6th 
are the same ones that we examined last year in our study. This 
is why I sit before you today to discuss a little bit about 
what we learned about how technology and payments companies 
enable groups like those that participated in the insurrection 
to operate.
    These groups leverage the internet as a primary means of 
disseminating their toxic ideologies and soliciting of funds. 
One only needs to search Amazon or Etsy for the term, 
``QAnon'', to uncover shirts, hats, mugs, books, and other 
paraphernalia that both monetize and further popularize the 
domestic violent extremist threat. Images from that fateful day 
last month are rife with sweatshirts that say, ``Camp 
Auschwitz'', that, until recently, were for sale on websites 
like Teespring and CafePress.


I proposed bipartisan legislation called the Freezing 
Assets of Suspected Terrorists and Enemy Recruits (FASTER) Act, 
featured in today's hearing. This bill will help law 
enforcement to freeze the assets of domestic terrorists facing 
Federal charges for insurrection and seditious conspiracy, like 
those who stormed the Capitol, but also like ISIS-inspired lone 
wolf terrorists, and others of that ilk.
    Mr. Glaser, given your experience in the private sector and 
as the former Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and 
Financial Crimes, you know that for foreign terrorist 
organizations, the threshold for asset seizure is low. Given 
what transpired at the Capitol, do you believe that law 
enforcement could make use of greater authorities in certain 
cases for domestic extremism, such as insurrection or seditious 
conspiracy?


 Ms. Brooks. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question, and this 
really speaks to the earlier question as well. As I mentioned 
in my oral testimony, we note a massive decentralization of 
these groups and a disbursement of groups, so it makes it 
harder to track them and harder to follow the money. And we 
have noticed that the groups are continuing to self-disburse.
    Mr. Gottheimer. Are they using cryptocurrencies? Do you 
notice them using cryptocurrencies?
    Ms. Brooks. Oh, yes, sir. Hold on one second. I have 
something on that. Yes. Monetized propaganda has continued to 
increase and we see a lot of personalities distributing--I'm 
sorry. I apologize. I am looking for my notes on that. Hold on 
a second.


 Ms. Boukadoum. I think that is an excellent point. And in 
my written testimony that we submitted for the record, we 
highlight that RICO and conspiracy statutes are extremely broad 
and should absolutely be used against particularly organized 
White nationalist groups that, as you mentioned, espoused an 
ethno-national state that wants to get rid of and kill millions 
of people, but I would love to open it up for the other 
panelists.


 And so, the decrease in the White population serving as a 
numeric majority has served to create fear and anxiety in the 
White population. As we saw with the ascension of President 
Obama, that was kind of a peak moment, and an example, if you 
will, for Whites who were beginning to think that they were 
being displaced, and feeding into a White nationalist trope 
around the great replacement or White genocide.
    So, we have seen an increase in that rhetoric. What we saw 
over the last 6 years was an increase in that rhetoric that was 
echoed from the highest office in the country, from the 
President, and that served to kind of fuel and carry the 
disinformation, fear, and anxiety to this fever-pitch position 
in which we find ourselves in today.


 Mr. Auchincloss. I just want to state, for the record, how 
much I agree with standing together. I think the Jewish people, 
as well as my African-American constituents know that where 
there is conspiracy theorizing, where there is extremism, it is 
just a matter of time before they come for Black Americans and 
for Jewish Americans, such has been our history. So, thank you 
for saying that.
    Mr. Rogers, I welcome your thoughts as well.
    Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Congressman. And I could not agree 
more with both your thoughts and Ms. Brooks, your statement on 
the subject, another subject that I am passionate about as 
well. As you say, if history is any guide, hate is hate, and it 
always comes for people of color and the Jewish community as 
well.
    One other point I would add is that in many ways, the QAnon 
conspiracy theory phenomenon is itself a kind of remix, if you 
will, or a mash-up of historically all of the various sorts of 
anti-Semitic Jewish blood libels. The idea of the cabal at the 
top, et cetera, et cetera, that if not explicit, is a very 
thinly veiled version of the same blood libel that has been 
circulating for a hundred, if not, hundreds of years.
    And so, yes, I think they go very much hand in hand whether 
explicit or not, and I think they are linked and solidarity is 
obviously of utmost importance.
	And so, yes, I think they go very much hand in hand whether 
explicit or not, and I think they are linked and solidarity is 
obviously of utmost importance.
    Mr. Auchincloss. Mr. Rogers, are there particular actions 
that you would recommend Congress pursue relative to anti-
Semitism and the intersection of anti-Semitism and domestic 
terrorism, in particular, and the spread of disinformation 
about that?
    Mr. Rogers. I think there are a number of regulatory fronts 
that all go to the general problem of disinformation as a 
whole, and I don't know that we have the time to get into all 
of them here, but I think they certainly fall into three big 
categories, with the one most relevant to today's discussion 
being this idea of government platform liability, that our data 
is showing what a key role these sorts of platforms play in 
facilitating the activities of these groups.",Testimony on Funding Mechanisms and Extremism Financing,"The provided text features testimony from distinguished witnesses discussing the funding mechanisms of domestic violent extremist groups, including their reliance on online platforms and the dissemination of propaganda. The witnesses highlight the decentralized nature of these groups, their use of cryptocurrencies, and the need for legislative action to combat extremism and disinformation. Additionally, there is emphasis on the intersection of anti-Semitism with domestic terrorism and recommendations for regulatory measures to address these issues."

 For two weeks, he withheld from Congress and the public the 
data and analysis that demonstrated how his leadership 
undermined the actual mission of the Postal Service--to deliver 
the mail.
    Days later, details of Mr. DeJoy's personal lack of ethics 
have come to light. He reportedly forged his own brother's 
signature to take greater control of his family's company. Mr. 
DeJoy, reportedly, and potentially illegally, used the family 
company as a personal political action committee, coercing his 
staff, reportedly, to donate to preferred Republican 
candidates, and then reimbursing those employees with bonuses 
and salary.
    If true, DeJoy's actions should have been of great concern 
to the Board of Governors and could be prosecuted for criminal 
activity.
    But we're not done. Over the weekend, the Postmaster 
General sent every home in America a mailer instructing all who 
seek to vote by mail to request a mail-in ballot, sending 
misinformation and confusing voters in nine states that 
automatically send out such ballots. This debacle could have 
been avoided if Mr. DeJoy had simply accepted the offers of 
state election officials to proofread that message before he 
sent it out.


 We have 11 months, as of right now, 11 months to come 
together to work in a bipartisan fashion to bring real reforms 
to the Postal Service, just like, Mr. Chairman, you did with my 
predecessor, Mark Meadows. But instead of having a serious 
discussion about proposals for a postal reform bill, we are 
using this valuable time to delve into conspiracy theories 
about the Koch family and to opine into Mr. DeJoy's financial 
interests.


 Mr. Keller. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    First, I would like to echo the sentiments of the ranking 
member and say that reports about the Postmaster General are 
speculation. This hearing is another attempt to attack the 
Postmaster General instead of tackling the real issue of postal 
reform.
    My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been 
critical of Postmaster DeJoy's focus on operational 
efficiencies and have launched into conspiracy theories that 
these are somehow tied to destroying the Postal Service.
    So, the key question is: Why does USPS need be to 
efficient? The answer is simple: It's so Americans can have a 
reliable and affordable Postal Service.


Last, I want to address the false notion about privatizing 
the Postal Service. Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit to the 
record the USPS Mission Statement from the agency's website 
adopted by the Board of Governors on April 1, 2020.
    Mr. Connolly. Without objection.
    Mr. Keller. Thank you. This statement was adopted by the 
very Board of Governors that some witnesses today claim are 
hyperpartisan actors. It was also created before Postmaster 
DeJoy arrived and remains unchanged. It states that part of its 
mission is to serve the American people and through the 
universal service obligation bind our Nation together by 
maintaining and operating our unique, vital, and resilient 
infrastructure.
    To carry out this mission, the Board of Governors states 
that the Postal Service will remain an integral part of the 
U.S. Government, providing all Americans with universal and 
open access to our unrivaled delivery and storefront network.


 When it comes to the question of whether or not Mr. DeJoy 
broke any campaign finance laws, Mr. Painter, wouldn't you 
agree that, really, you have no more information than the 
general public has at this point?
    Mr. Painter. No, that is a false statement, and----
    Mr. Hice. You did two or three times, sir.
    Mr. Painter. I did not. And I'm going to repeat that I do 
not know whether the campaign finance laws were violated. It is 
a false statement that I assumed guilt.",Controversies Surrounding the Postmaster General,"Recent controversies surrounding Postmaster General DeJoy have sparked intense scrutiny and debate. Allegations include withholding critical data from Congress, unethical business practices such as forging signatures and coercing employees for political donations, and disseminating misleading information about mail-in voting. Critics argue that these actions undermine the Postal Service's mission and public trust. However, defenders emphasize the importance of operational efficiency for a reliable and affordable Postal Service, dismissing claims of deliberate sabotage. The focus on DeJoy's conduct detracts from the urgent need for bipartisan postal reform efforts, raising concerns about the politicization of the issue."

SEC. 3. HPV VACCINE PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN.

    Section 317 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247b) is 
amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(o) HPV Vaccine Public Awareness Campaign.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary, acting through the

 Democracies around the world have put in place 
unprecedented safety measures from emergency declarations to 
restrictions on free assembly to protect their people from the 
deadly virus.
    However, we must ensure these restrictions on civil and 
political rights are not abused by the governments looking to 
consolidate power. I am particularly troubled by the 
restrictions on press freedoms being implemented in certain 
countries under the pretext of preventing the spread of 
disinformation on the virus.
    While the spread of false information on COVID-19 has 
serious potential health risks, the exploitation of these 
restrictions cannot be ignored. I am sure we will hear more on 
this from the minority's witness in the form of the president 
of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty Jamie Fly.


 So democracy was already in fragile health in various 
countries, and once COVID struck the condition worsened because 
of emergency laws and other measures.
    A few vivid examples. First, a number of countries enacted 
fake news laws. For example, Russia criminalized false 
information about the pandemic, which has been used to restrict 
and stifle independent reporting about the pandemic.
    Second, countries have begun using invasive surveillance. 
In Poland, for example, people suspected of having COVID are 
required to download an app so the government will know their 
location at all times.
    Third, governments are repressing peaceful protests. 
Consider Belarus. Students peacefully protesting are abducted 
by masked security forces and beaten, and this week Lukashenko 
told prosecutors they have all the laws they need to crack down 
on protests. Just like other authoritarians, Lukashenko has 
converted the rule of law into the rule by law.


 President Lukashenko is opting for repression and 
retrenchment over engagement and dialog. Yet, despite this, the 
Belarusian nation has been borne and we are all in awe.
    What distinguishes democracies is their ability to 
critically self-examine, learn lessons, adapt to become more 
resilient to better serve the interest of the people. Distrust, 
like disinformation, thrives when there is a perceived lack of 
transparency and accountability, and ultimately paralyses the 
State.
    As the number of infections rose, European authorities 
found that they not only had to deal with an evolving public 
health crisis but also with a surge of dis-and misinformation 
that actively undermined efforts to ensure public compliance 
with continued measures.
    By mid-March, the EU's External Action Service concluded 
that the disinformation could have a direct impact on public 
health and security and began more closely tracking and 
reacting to the infodemic, particularly narratives coming from 
Russian and Chinese official and State-backed actors.
    However, there is a positive. There is new impetus to 
improve accountability and transparency, to increase public 
trust in institutions on the national and EU levels.
    The pandemic caused disinformation to jump the proverbial 
fence from a security issue to being understood as posing a 
physical threat to the whole of society and thus requiring a 
whole of society response.
    Crucially, there is an even greater appreciation for the 
need to engage nongovernmental actors both in efforts to push 
back against disinformation as well as to engage them and civil 
society as an important partner.
    Authoritarian regimes like to present themselves as more 
resilient. Yet, COVID-19 likewise exposed governance gaps 
Belarus was unable or unwilling to acknowledge and remedy.
    By continuing to deny the existence of COVID-19 and 
advising the use of vodka as a preventative treatment while 
people were becoming gravely ill and dying, Alexander 
Lukashenko lost public trust and undermined his image as 
benevolent father of the Belarusian. It also directly 
contravened one of the core pillars of his social contract 
whereby State-sponsored benefits are offered in exchange for 
political apathy.
   

Ms. Laanela. I think I am the wrong person to start because 
I think my colleagues know--I have been so impressed by my 
colleagues.
    But let me just--let me tell my perspective and I think 
theirs will be even more important. We do not track 
interference as such, but what we try to do or what we believe 
to be true is to strengthen the institutions that need to 
safeguard.
    So let me explain what I mean. We create institutions for a 
reason in our societies and that is to protect public good, 
something that we value, something that we treasure very, very 
much.
    And so in the case of disinformation, for example, if we 
have institutions that can protect the public good of 
information that is correct or that is part of good and strong 
elections so--I am not articulating this well.
    But if--institutions that are strong, what we are seeing, 
those that are able to safeguard against disinformation, for 
example, they are working in innovative ways because this isn't 
a challenge that existed, really, as much before social media, 
and one of the things that we are seeing is a kind of 
interagency cooperation, a partnership between private and 
public that is really--has not been seen before.
    Let me just take Australia as a case. But the working 
together with social media companies and government agencies 
and security agencies and election officials for rapid reaction 
to anything that comes in, and that kind of seamless 
communication between agencies, that is one of the ways in 
which we can protect----


And, Chairman Keating, you brought up something and I 
really appreciate you bringing it up, and it is the challenge 
of media. At some point, there has to be a metric where what 
the media is reporting is true, and I know this is going to 
rattle some people.
    If you have false news going out there intentionally by a 
nefarious organization, there has to be a way to rein that in 
and I have not found a good way to do that. And, I value our 
First Amendment and we have to fight to preserve that.
    But at the same time, there has to be a responsibility in 
media to report accurately so that we do not have this chaos, 
because I know there is organizations that are fomenting chaos 
whether it is coming from Russia or China.


 Mr. Cicilline. Great.
    The next thing I want to ask you about is, obviously, the 
dissemination of false information has been a real problem in 
terms of response to this pandemic and using it both as ways to 
suppress the public and dissent but also to promote bad public 
health policies.
    And, you know, there is tremendous concern about that in 
our own country and the role that these platforms have in terms 
of preventing or at least reducing the likelihood that, you 
know, inaccurate or dangerous public health information is 
disseminated.
    And, you know, are there some examples where you think the 
European Union or other countries that have done a better job 
than the United States in helping prevent the dissemination of 
false information that is resulting in the deaths of thousands 
of Americans that we ought to look at in terms of protocols or 
standards?
	Ms. Rohozinska. So I will probably--I will probably take 
this.
    I mean, I think that the first thing was that they got on 
top of it really quickly, that it was very quickly recognized 
as being a problem that was not limited to a single country.
    And so whether on a single country basis or on an EU wide 
basis, they quite quickly started tracking and trying to debunk 
it. I think that there is a couple of good examples, country by 
country, in which they actually did engage the groups that have 
been, on the civil society side, either fact checking or 
debunking or raising awareness or doing media literacy 
programs.
    And we actually reached out to this community and engaged 
them, on one hand, to help try and track and to nip in the bud 
the disinformation that was flowing through and, on other hand, 
to actually--and Slovakia was a good example, that the ministry 
of health actually paired up with civil society organizations 
to help disseminate good information, right, understanding that 
they had a farther reach and they had a legitimacy that the 
government was shortfall on.
    So it definitely has come back to being that all of this is 
public trust, frankly--that the countries in which there is 
high levels of public trust just simply did a better job 
extending this.
    The other thing that was important to note with the 
infodemic is, again, you know, times of crisis and times of 
uncertainty breeds conspiracies and disinformation, I mean, and 
it does not matter when we are in history.
	  We will always find this happening. It is human nature, if 
you want. And so, in a way, the more information----
    Mr. Cicilline. And I just want to--Joanna, if I can jump in 
real quick because my time has run out----
    Ms. Rohozinska. Yes. Yes.
    Mr. Cicilline [continuing]. To ask one more question to 
relate to that. You know, we have seen in our own country the 
exploitation of the pandemic, the dissemination by our 
president of misinformation to voters, the degrading of voting 
from home, the undermining of the Postal Service, the calling 
in question the legitimacy of our elections, the suppressing of 
peaceful dissent by gassing peaceful protesters, attacks on our 
independent media.",Safeguarding Democratic Values Amidst the Pandemic,"As democracies grapple with the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns arise about the erosion of civil and political rights under the guise of public safety measures. Instances of restrictions on press freedoms, invasive surveillance, and repression of peaceful protests are highlighted as troubling trends in certain countries. Belarus serves as a poignant example of a government resorting to repression rather than engagement with its citizens. Moreover, the proliferation of disinformation exacerbates the crisis, necessitating a coordinated response to combat false narratives and uphold public trust. European Union initiatives demonstrate proactive efforts to counter disinformation and promote accurate information dissemination, emphasizing the importance of engaging civil society organizations and ensuring public trust. In the United States, concerns are raised about the exploitation of the pandemic for political purposes, including dissemination of misinformation, undermining of democratic institutions, and suppression of dissent. Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort to uphold democratic values, transparency, and accountability in governance."

 First, the STRATEGIC bill challenges the unfair and illegal 
PRC economic practices that undermine U.S. businesses and an 
international economic system based on free market growth.
    The STRATEGIC Act focuses in particular on increased 
oversight of Chinese company behavior in U.S. capital markets 
and Chinese state-sponsored intellectual property theft. We are 
all aware of the many cases that this has happened, and we have 
got to put an end to this.
    This legislation also addresses the CCP malign influence in 
our media, universities, and even Government. We must ensure 
that our society remains open and free but also resilient and 
aware of the ways in which the CCP attempts to suppress, 
influence, or steal information within the United States.


 The Trump administration was instrumental in drawing 
international attention to many of the risks of growing Chinese 
power and influence, and it put in place a number of policies 
to protect the United States from unfair and even malign 
Chinese economic and political activities.


The United States should also encourage deeper European security 
engagement in Asia. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has called 
for NATO to play a larger role in the Asia Pacific region, coordinating 
with Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea to support global 
rules and set norms and standards in space and cyberspace in the face 
of destabilizing Chinese behavior.\6\ Europe could take part in 
conversations the Quad is pursuing around supply chain resiliency, the 
pandemic, and disinformation campaigns as well.\7\ Importantly, a 
stronger Europe-Asia security partnership could play an crucial role in 
bolstering Taiwan's security.


 On the issue of China, Dr. Economy, I want to talk to you 
about what we are doing with the Global Engagement Center. This 
is to try to push back on disinformation and propaganda. China 
is very good at it.
    Last year, Senator Booker and I chaired an oversight 
hearing of this committee on combating disinformation and the 
expert witnesses told us that China spends over $10 billion 
annually in state-sponsored disinformation operations. Ten 
billion dollars annually.
    And so my question to you, Dr. Economy, is can you 
elaborate a little on China's use of disinformation? It is 
inexpensive. It has got a lot of deniability attached to it.
    I listened carefully to what Senator Shaheen said about 
Latin America. They are certainly engaged in there and in 
Africa. What are the most pressing areas where you have studied 
China disinformation campaigns and why do they use this tactic 
and what should we be doing to push back against it?
    Dr. Economy. Thank you, Senator.
    Certainly, look, we are right in the midst of a Chinese 
disinformation campaign ourselves, right, as the Chinese are 
spreading untruths about the United States as the source of 
COVID-19, you know.
	nese efforts is critical. But I think in other countries 
that have a less robust free press is one of the greatest 
concerns in my mind. If you look in Africa, for example, where 
Chinese media companies are managing not only, for example, the 
digitization of villages in Kenya but also providing the 
content for Kenyan television in many villages, and the 
newspapers are, basically, doing what they used to do with AP. 
It is much cheaper--they can just get for free from Renmin 
Ribao or China Daily.
    And so what you are getting in many developing countries 
now is just a flood of Chinese information. And so it is a 
little bit different, maybe, from disinformation, but it is a 
close second because it is, basically, spreading a Chinese 
narrative and cutting out access to, you know, other sources of 
information.
    For example, in Kenya they price access to the BBC and 
other international stations at a higher rate to dissuade 
people from buying access to that kind of information.
    So, they influenced the recent Taiwanese elections or 
attempted to. They spread all sorts of disinformation over the 
course of COVID-19 pandemic about other countries' responses.
    I think that the most important thing we can do is simply 
to shed light on the lies, to push back against them and act in 
concert with our allies on this.
    Our best response is sort of the transparency that is 
inherent in our own system.


 Dr. Economy. So, briefly, I think the Chinese very well 
understand what appropriate norms are. We had a cyber agreement 
with them. I think it was signed in 2015 under the Obama 
administration. There seemed to be a dip in cyber attacks.
    But then later people said it was simply because the cyber 
attacks were more sophisticated and we just were not picking up 
on them at the same rate.
    So I do not think there is an issue where China does not 
understand what it means to protect intellectual property or 
does not understand what they are doing with their cyber 
economic espionage.
    And I am afraid that there is not much point in norm 
discussions, but there probably is some point in working with 
allies to bring pressure to bear upon them in some way.
    Senator Rounds. Thank you.
    Mr. Shugart?
    Mr. Shugart. I, largely, agree with Dr. Economy there.
    We know that Chinese cyber activity has been quite 
deleterious to the military balance in the Pacific. There are 
numerous examples of Chinese platforms of weapon systems and 
sensors that are very closely modeled on what we have 
developed.

  Dr. Economy, as I have listened to the three people 
testifying this morning, I am struck by the massive investment 
China is making around the world, an investment and propaganda, 
investment in sending students around the world.


 Just another question I will ask you, Dr. Economy, or the 
other members of the panel as well, which it is very clear that 
China has an extraordinarily comprehensive strategy to dominate 
the region, and I would suggest once they feel they have 
dominated the region they intend to dominate the world.
    And, I mean, their strategy includes their military, their 
competitiveness economically, their propaganda efforts, the 
management of their own people, their monitoring of their own 
people, their geopolitical strategy with Belt and Road, the 
technology transfer.
",Examining China's Comprehensive Strategy for Global Dominance,"The text highlights the multifaceted approach China employs to assert its dominance globally, encompassing economic competitiveness, military advancements, propaganda efforts, technological prowess, and geopolitical strategies such as the Belt and Road Initiative. Through substantial investments in propaganda, student exchange programs, and technology transfer, China aims to expand its influence and control, potentially with the ambition of global domination. Experts testify to China's cyber activities, intellectual property theft, and military advancements, emphasizing the need for vigilance and concerted efforts, including norm discussions and alliances, to counter China's aggressive tactics and protect international interests."

 I want to thank the witnesses. And I also want to thank 
your teams, because you represent what is on the front lines of 
President Trump's plan to combat the coronavirus crisis.
    For anybody to suggest that there's not a plan--in fact, 
when you look at the title of today's hearing, ``Urgent Need 
for a Plan,'' that's not the title of a hearing. That's a 
political narrative, and a false political narrative at that.
    You wouldn't even be here today if there wasn't a plan, 
because you are the people tasked with carrying out the plan. 
In fact, if you were sidelined, you wouldn't be here either. 
And I know some people want to suggest that, but maybe they 
haven't spent time reading different components of the plan.


 So, you look at where we have seen the Chinese Government. 
We hopefully will get into conversations about how costly it 
was, how many lives were lost because the Chinese Communist 
Party lied to the world, not just the United States, but the 
world, getting the World Health Organization to give false 
information in those critical early days.


 Blaming other countries is not a plan. Blaming China is not 
a plan. Blaming China is not even a good excuse for the lethal 
incompetence and disinformation of President Trump.
    China's early cover-up of the disease only deepens the 
responsibility and complicity of President Trump who, on 37 
different occasions, as I've demonstrated by submissions to 
this committee, defended and excused and praised the Chinese 
Government and President Xi.


 Mr. Raskin. Well, I thank you for that, and I thank both 
you and Dr. Fauci for restating the absolute imperative 
importance of everybody wearing their masks when they're out in 
public and everybody maintaining social distance and following 
the other public health protocols.
    But the public health officials have been subjected to 
harassment, and we've even seen some today, have been subjected 
to ridicule, and have been subjected to ludicrous, absurd 
contradiction.
    So, I want to go through some of the propaganda and 
disinformation quickly just as a public service announcement, 
because America is watching you.
    And, Dr. Fauci, why don't I start with you.
    Are children almost immune to the disease? Just yes or no, 
because I've got a lot to get through, please. Are children 
almost immune to the disease?
    Dr. Fauci. I'm sorry. You really have to--be a little bit 
more precise. You mean almost immune. Do children get infected? 
Yes, they do.
    Mr. Raskin. Have hundreds of thousands of children been 
infected?
    Dr. Fauci. Yes.
    Mr. Raskin. Hundreds of thousands of children infected. So, 
children are not almost immune to the disease.
    Is COVID-19 going to magically disappear, Dr. Fauci?
    Dr. Fauci. I do not believe it would disappear. Because 
it's such a highly transmissible virus, it is unlikely that 
it's going to disappear.
    Mr. Raskin. Does wearing a mask give people COVID-19?
    Dr. Fauci. Does wearing a mask give it? No.
    Mr. Raskin. OK.


",Addressing Misinformation and Accountability in the COVID-19 Crisis,"The text highlights the importance of countering misinformation and holding leaders accountable in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It criticizes false narratives and blames the Chinese government for its early cover-up of the disease.

The exchange underscores the need for clear communication and fact-based responses in combating the pandemic."

 But if you consider these threats--for example, I will just 
quick go down the list: cyber attacks, and these are cyber 
attacks, ransomware, intellectual property theft, something 
that we are concerned about right now as we try and develop 
vaccines, but the hundreds and billions of dollars of economic 
loss due to intellectual property theft; potential cyber 
attacks and threats against our critical infrastructure; drug 
trafficking and the overdose crisis; gangs like MS-13; 
electromagnetic pulse (EMP) and geomagnetic disturbance (GMD) 
threats to our electrical grid; the malign use of drones; human 
trafficking; election security; and school and other mass 
shootings. These are issues, these are threats that this 
Committee has not only held hearings on but passed some pretty 
significant pieces of legislation.


We continue to face a number of security threats, both old 
and new. Over the past year, since we last held this hearing, 
unfortunately that list has only continued to grow.
    Not only do we continue to face critical threats from 
foreign and domestic terrorism, cyber attacks, and efforts by 
foreign governments to sow chaos within our country, we are 
also dealing with a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic that has 
tragically taken the lives of over 200,000 Americans.
    This public health disaster has also further exposed a 
significant security risk embedded in the tools we use every 
single day to connect us with the world.
    As we have moved more of our daily lives online because of 
coronavirus, bad actors have exploited technological weaknesses 
to attack the platforms we use for remote school and work.
    Adversaries are working to infiltrate private companies and 
government agencies who are part of the critical race to find a 
vaccine.
    Both foreign and domestic actors have also seized on 
misinformation and disinformation, chipping away at the very 
fabric of our democracy and sowing discord and mistrust in the 
institutions we rely on every day to keep us safe.


 Just recently, for example, we shared threat indicators 
with Facebook and Twitter that allowed them to take down fake 
accounts created as part of a Russian disinformation campaign 
before those accounts could develop some kind of broader 
following.
    Turning to the cyber arena, we are focused on an 
increasingly diverse array of threats from our cyber 
adversaries, from State-sponsored Chinese intrusions to 
intrusions by Russia, Iran, North Korea, sophisticated cyber 
criminals seeking to exploit technical vulnerabilities 
primarily for personal profit.
    Last week, I announced the FBI's new cyber strategy, 
leveraging our unique expertise and authorities to impose risk 
and consequences on our cyber adversaries. We are focusing on 
results on impact, and that means we are working to enable our 
partners' operations as well as our own.


So given the COVID-19 pandemic, we are seeing many more 
people vote by mail. As I mentioned, unprecedented numbers of 
absentee ballots have been asked for in the State of Michigan. 
I want to dispel some of this drumbeat of misinformation that 
we are hearing out there. So my question is very direct. Is 
voting by mail secure?
    Mr. Wray. Senator, I think what I would say is this: We 
take all election-related threats seriously, whether it is 
voter fraud, voter suppression, whether it is in person, 
whether it is by mail. And our role is to investigate the 
threat actors.


 As far as foreign influence, malign foreign influence here 
domestically, investigating that is the FBI's lead, as well as 
investigating cyber intrusions into election infrastructure. 
But DHS takes the lead in terms of protecting infrastructure 
and mitigation and response to that. You mentioned CYBERCOM. 
Obviously, to the extent that there is offensive cyber----
    Senator Peters. So there is not one entity necessarily in 
charge. You just take care--you have your different lanes to 
run in, you cooperate, but there is not one person that is 
going to be----
    Mr. Wray. As is true, frankly, with counterterrorism.
    Senator Peters. OK.


 Senator Peters. I appreciate it. In the limited time I 
have, Director Wray, just a final question, because you 
mentioned a foreign government influence in the election and 
misinformation. Give us some advice. How can American voters 
recognize an attempt by a foreign government to influence their 
opinion and vote? It is important, I know behind the scenes you 
are working, we have all the different agencies that are 
working. But how do we let the American voter know this is 
basically a disinformation campaign that is perpetrated by a 
foreign government? How should they recognize that?
    Mr. Wray. I think it is a challenge, as your question 
alludes to. I would say when it comes to information about 
their vote itself, where to vote, when to vote, hours of the 
polling places, information about the results, things like 
that, it is very important that Americans get that information 
from their official state or local election website as opposed 
to relying on something that might be on social media, for 
example.
    As far as getting their news, which might shift or 
influence their views more broadly, I would encourage people to 
be critical thinkers and to get their news from a variety of 
sources and make up their own mind and be a skeptical, 
discerning electorate, which is what I think is the best 
defense against malign foreign influence and disinformation.


 Director Miller, before we run out of time--and I have only 
got a few seconds, and I apologize for that--there is the issue 
of China. Director O'Brien has made the comment that there is a 
rise in China trying to be able to engage in our election this 
year, and he identified that as one of our greatest threats. 
Can you briefly comment on that and what you are seeing right 
now? Is it just influence or is it in actual cyber attacks in 
our system?
    Mr. Miller. Thanks, Senator. I look at international 
terrorism specifically. I am not really familiar with the----
    Senator Lankford. OK. Can anyone else comment on that 
briefly?
    Mr. Cuccinelli. Briefly. Each of the two areas you 
mentioned, China is a major threat. They are a rising power, 
and they have every intention of trying to rival and surpass us 
as a Nation, and they have stolen our intellectual property at 
a level Director Wray said last week in a phrase I thought was 
very applicable. ``The greatest transfer of wealth in the 
history of the world'' is the Chinese stealing intellectual 
property from Americans, and for their strategic purpose, 
military, intelligence, and their economy.


Senator Lankford. Great. Thank you. I appreciate that. Let 
me do my last minute and 15 seconds here. I do want to drill 
down on this issue about China and trying to malign influence 
for the election in particular. When Director O'Brien made that 
comment, obviously we are dealing with Russia and what they did 
in 2016. We are all very aware of how they were trying to 
engage in our election. But his comment seemed to be that China 
is being even more aggressive behind the scenes this time than 
Russia was. We also know that Iran is trying to be able to 
influence our elections. I did not know if there was any 
clarity that any of you could bring to that. Obviously, he is 
not sitting at the table today, but if there are any other 
comments about that.
    Mr. Cuccinelli. I would just note that the way China acts 
in that arena is different than Russia and Iran, in part 
because they have so many more levers. Iran and Russia do not 
have the trade with us that China has. They do not have the 
relationships at every level of government that China has. And 
they do not have the connections to our economy and so forth.
    So they do not have the levers that China has available to 
them. We have seen through this year COVID was an excellent 
example as we roll into the election season where they have 
Ambassadors in other countries, they have their foreign 
minister. They are taking on false narratives aimed at the 
United States very overtly and then spreading them through 
their media outlets in ways that our other opponents do not 
have available to them. So it is a very unique attack.


e jumped out of obscure Web forms and, unfortunately, now 
are prominently featured on traditional social media. Even more 
concerning, they are manifesting themselves in real-world 
incidents of violence.
    So my question to you, Mr. Wray, is: Is there a risk that 
foreign actors will try to leverage some Americans' belief in 
some of these conspiracy theories that are floating around 
quite widely? And will they use that to engineer some violent 
confrontations? How concerned should we be about that?
    Mr. Wray. Certainly there are sort of two strands that you 
are alluding to there that we are concerned about. One is the 
sheer impact of social media on the threats that we face. So in 
the terrorism context, we say that terrorism today moves at the 
speed of social media, and that is really across all the 
different terrorist threats.
    Then, separately, you have this effect also facilitated by 
social media where foreign adversaries will identify trends, 
divisive issues, in some cases conspiracy theories, that they 
will then in effect piggyback on and amplify and push to suit 
their own policy goals and propaganda. And we see that across a 
range of adversaries--Russia, of course, but also China, also 
Iran. And so it is a real concern.


 Director Wray, I appreciated in your opening comments your 
discussion of cyber threats. Could you drill down a bit more on 
what the FBI is doing to help protect State and local 
governments and other non-Federal partners from ongoing cyber 
attacks and to deter malicious cyber adversaries?
    Mr. Wray. Senator, I appreciate the question, and I do 
recall our exchange from last year. Certainly, ransomware is a 
particularly concerning part of the cyber threat that we face 
and the threat of ransomware against State and local 
governments is particularly high. There are a variety of 
reasons why ransomware actors target municipalities, hospitals, 
police forces, et cetera.
    Senator Hassan. Right.
    Mr. Wray. One of the things that we have done recently is 
through our National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force, we 
have brought together a whole-of-government effort to focus 
across multiple agency, intelligence community (IC), and law 
enforcement on the most damaging ransomware variants. And some 
of that is through investigative activity disruptions; some of 
that is through outreach and engagement where we work very 
closely with CISA at DHS to help educate those entities on how 
to better harden and protect their infrastructure, because 
certainly having good cyber hygiene backups, et cetera, is one 
of the best defenses against ransomware.


 We have talked today, as Director Miller has said, that the 
terrorist groups al-Qaeda, ISIS, and others continue on the 
attack. That is a threat. We cannot forget. We cannot take our 
eye off the ball. As we have heard from CISA here in this 
Committee consistently, these cyber attacks are on the rise. By 
the way, this Committee is focused on that a lot and will 
continue to. We did a Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations 
(PSI) recently about this issue, and I think, as you know, 
Deputy Secretary Cuccinelli, I am very concerned about the 
Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) 
implementation at some of our Federal agencies. They are just 
not doing it. They are not protecting themselves, which means 
they are not protecting the taxpayers, not protecting the 
government. And we are going to have some legislation on that, 
but we have to work together to put the firewalls in place more 
effectively.


 Mr. Wray, can you give us some examples of what Russia, 
China, and Iran have been doing to spread disinformation and 
misinformation ahead of the election? How does the Bureau work 
to proactively combat this misinformation?
    Mr. Wray. I would refer you to the Office of the Director 
of National Intelligence (ODNI's) public statement that is the 
unclassified version of what the intelligence community 
assesses from our foreign adversaries with respect to election 
interference, and it goes through a description of China, 
Russia, and Iran. All three countries are highly sophisticated 
actors with different capabilities pursuing different means--in 
the case of the Russians and the Iranians, heavy use of online 
tools, for example. You have heard about the use of social 
media. We are seeing online journals, fake placement of 
stories, things like that, use of proxies by the Russians, for 
example.
    On the Chinese, as I mentioned before, in many ways it is 
our greatest counterintelligence threat to this country, and 
their malign foreign influence efforts are different, as Mr. 
Cuccinelli said, different from the Russians, but much broader 
and wider in terms of their reach to not just Federal officials 
but State and local officials. They use economic levers very 
heavily. We are mostly concerned about subversive, undeclared, 
coercive, or criminal means. There is obviously all kinds of 
overt lobbying that occurs by these countries, but those are 
the means that we are most concerned about.


Certainly, as I have said before, the Russians are 
engaging--and as the ODNI's statement on behalf of the 
intelligence community says, they are engaged in a range of 
measures. But also the Chinese have recently been expanding 
their influence efforts, which is part of why after the midterm 
elections, with the Foreign Influence Task Force that I created 
early in my tenure, we broadened and significantly added 
resources to that task force to add not just Russia but to add 
China and Iran as well, because those countries are very much 
looking for different ways to take a page out of the malign 
foreign influence playbook that they have seen elsewhere.


 In the Department of Justice Inspector General Horowitz's 
report, former Assistant Director Bill Priestap was quoted as 
saying that the FBI did not have any indication whatsoever as 
of May 2017 that the Russians were running a disinformation 
campaign. Because my staff uncovered four classified 
footnotes--and, again, I think that just points to why this is 
so important that we make this information available. But in 
those four classified footnotes, we now know the FBI in early 
October 2016, the Crossfire Hurricane team actually did obtain 
information from a Steele subsource that ``he was suspected of 
being linked to Russian intelligence services and rumored to be 
a former Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation 
(KGB SVR) officer.''


 I think my question on this is: As the current FBI 
Director, do you believe the Crossfire Hurricane investigation 
should have proceeded at all once the FBI knew that the KGB 
might have been one of Steele's subsources and that Russian 
disinformation was contained in the Steele dossier?
    Mr. Wray. Mr. Chairman, first let me try to answer your 
question this way: I think the Inspector General's report about 
the Crossfire Hurricane investigation describes conduct that I 
consider unacceptable, unrepresentative of who the FBI is as an 
organization, and cannot be allowed to be repeated. I have 
implemented over 40 corrective measures to address those 
issues.",Addressing Security Threats in the Modern Era,"The text discusses a range of security threats facing the United States, including cyber attacks, misinformation campaigns, and foreign interference in elections. Government officials emphasize the need for collaboration between agencies to combat these threats effectively. Director Wray highlights the importance of educating voters to recognize disinformation campaigns and advises them to seek information from official sources. Additionally, concerns about China's attempts to influence the U.S. election are raised, prompting further examination of potential cyber attacks and foreign interference."

 Here at home, extremist rhetoric on-line, rising political 
tensions and the proliferation of disinformation have brought 
us to a boiling point. We have seen flashes of it in the last 
few years. Moments that have given us a window into the threat 
posed by violent domestic groups in Charlottesville in 2017, in 
my own district, Lansing in 2020, and tragically, on January 6 
in the Nation's Capitol.


  Last week, the director of national intelligence in 
collaboration with Justice and Homeland Security, released an 
assessment warning that domestic violent extremists pose an 
elevated risk to the homeland this year. This assessment 
cautions that extremists will continue to be radicalized and 
will mobilize around narratives of election fraud, pandemic 
restrictions, conspiracy theories, and the attack on the 6th. 
The threat assessment also laid out important terminology that 
our intelligence and law enforcement officers use to describe 
these threats. It is important that we get on the same page.


  Many of you know, although domestic terrorism is defined in 
Federal law, there are no specific Federal domestic terrorism 
charges. While some of these investigations may result in--some 
investigations do result in serious charges, such as hate 
crimes and gun charges. In the case of January 6, we have had 
perpetrators charged with conspiracy and sedition. Many of 
these domestic terrorism-related investigations will not 
progress as terrorism-related charges.


 Here at home, extremist rhetoric on-line, rising political 
tensions, and the proliferation of disinformation have brought us to a 
boiling point. We've seen flashes of it over the last few years--
moments that have given us a window into the threat posed by violent 
domestic groups--in Charlottesville (2017); in Lansing (2020); and 
tragically, on January 6, in the Nation's capital.


 Last week, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence 
(ODNI) in collaboration with the Departments of Justice and Homeland 
Security released an assessment warning that domestic violent 
extremists (DVEs) pose an elevated risk to the homeland this year. The 
assessment cautions that extremists will continue to be radicalized and 
will mobilize around narratives of election fraud, pandemic 
restrictions, conspiracy theories, and the January 6 attack on the 
Capitol. That assessment also lays out the terminology that our 
intelligence and law enforcement communities use to describe these 
threats.


 As we all know here, although domestic terrorism is defined in 
Federal law, there is no specific Federal domestic terrorism charge. 
And while some of these investigations may result in serious charges, 
such as hate crimes and gun charges--and in the case of January 6, 
we've seen perpetrators be charged with conspiracy and now possibly 
sedition--many of these domestic terrorism-related investigations will 
not progress as terrorism-related charges.


 In addition to the recent attacks on the Capitol, we have 
seen over the summer, attacks on Federal buildings throughout 
the country. Whether it is far left groups or far right groups, 
including a plot to kidnap the Governor of Michigan, it is 
completely unacceptable in this country to live or have a 
threat of fear, which is what terrorism, foreign or domestic, 
would have us do. Many of these violent threats are being 
driven by rampant disinformation and misinformation on-line. 
They have left Federal, State, and local authorities with new 
unprecedented challenges on dealing with this.
    All of this has led to worthwhile discussions and debates 
around the merits of whether new criminal statutes are needed 
to combat domestic terrorism. But at the end of the day, it is 
so important that we protect our First Amendment while keeping 
our citizens safe.


 Violent extremism by any group of any political persuasion is 
unacceptable.
    Many of these violent threats are being driven by rampant 
disinformation and misinformation on-line, and has left Federal, State, 
and local authorities with new, unprecedented challenges. All of this 
has led to worthwhile discussions and debates around the merits of 
whether new criminal statutes are needed to combat domestic terrorism. 
At the end of the day: We must protect our first amendment.


Our legislature recognized that laws should be enacted to 
adequately address the threats of terrorism against targets in 
our State. These statutes criminalize domestic terrorism by 
providing State prosecutors with the tools necessary to 
prosecute as 20-year felonies the following: Acts of domestic 
terrorism, providing material support or resources for 
terrorism, hindering prosecution of terrorism, communicating 
true or false threats of terrorism, disrupting 
telecommunications of public safety, education, or Government 
operations, and obtaining blueprints or security diagrams for 
terrorism to vulnerable targets like school buildings, houses 
of religious worship, stadiums, and infrastructure.


 In light of this serious and growing threat, I have expanded my 
Department's Hate Crimes Unit to now include Domestic Terrorism because 
of the overlap of extremist ideologies. I have also directed my 
department to work with FBI and Michigan State Police and to prioritize 
these cases for prosecutorial review. Luckily, Michigan is uniquely 
situated to address domestic terrorism because of the Michigan Anti-
Terrorism Act. This act went into effect with bipartisan support in 
April 2002 after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Our legislature recognized 
that laws should be enacted to adequately address the threats of 
terrorism against targets in our State. These statutes criminalize 
domestic terrorism by providing State prosecutors with the tools to 
prosecute as 20-year felonies:
   acts of domestic terrorism
   providing material support or resources for terrorism
   hindering prosecution of terrorism
   communicating true or false threats of terrorism
   disrupting telecommunications of public safety, education, 
        or Government operations; 


  A common tactic of sovereign citizens is to serve false 
legal documents such as summons, fines, or even arrest warrants 
on representatives of the Government from their own made-up 
courts. Sovereign citizens often target law enforcement 
officers, prosecutors, and judges as we are viewed as enforcing 
laws that they do not recognize. Even our broad definition of 
terrorism was not sufficient to address some of the common 
tactics of domestic terrorists.
    In 2019, I personally sponsored a bill in the Nevada State 
legislator that criminalized simulated or fake legal documents 
purporting to be from false courts with the intent to harass or 
defraud someone. When testifying on the bill I sponsored, a 
detective with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department 
assigned to the Southern Nevada Counter Terrorism Center said 
that he and other officers received fake indictments and arrest 
warrants for treason. The penalty for treason is death. The 
goal of this legislation was to crack down on this tactic used 
by sovereign citizens whether the tactic is being used as part 
of a scam or used to target and threaten violence.


 Nevada Revised Statues defines ``Acts of Terrorism'' and creates 
criminal penalties for Acts of Terrorism or Attempted Acts of 
Terrorism. This law was passed in the aftermath of 9/11 and has proved 
to be a powerful tool for Nevada in charging terrorists. The Nevada 
terrorism statute does not require us to prove hate, political 
ideology, or other motivation. Nev. Rev. Stat.  202.4415 defines 
terrorism as an attempted use of sabotage, coercion, or violence which 
is intended to ``Cause great bodily harm or death to the general 
population'' or substantial destruction, contamination, or impairment 
to a building, infrastructure, utilities, or natural resources/
environment. The laws used to prosecute terrorism and other related 
crimes as I just defined include:
   Nev. Rev. Stat.  202.445: Acts of terrorism or attempted 
        acts of terrorism.
   Nev. Rev. Stat.  202.4408: Threats or conveying false 
        information concerning acts of terrorism.
   Nev. Rev. Stat.  203.117: Criminal Syndicalism (rarely 
        used.)
   Nev. Rev. Stat.  412.604: Laws Relating to ``Militias'' 
        where it is unlawful to drill or parade with arms by voluntary 
        company or voluntary organization without license or consent of 
        Governor (rarely used.)
   Nev. Rev. Stat.  203.080: Makes it a misdemeanor for ``any 
        body of individuals other than municipal police, university or 
        public school cadets or companies, militia of the State or 
        troops of the United States, to associate themselves together 
        as a military company with arms without the consent of the 
        Governor.''


 A common tactic of sovereign citizens is to serve false legal 
documents such as summons, fines, or even arrest warrants on 
representatives of the Government from their own made-up courts. 
Sovereign citizens often target law enforcement officers, prosecutors, 
and judges as we are viewed as enforcing laws they do not recognize. 
Some sovereign citizens file false liens against properties to prevent 
their sale, fake tax returns, or other documents as the basis of 
financial fraud. For example, sovereign citizens have served fake court 
documents to Nevadans, especially seniors, ordering that person to pay 
a fine or another amount as part of a scam.
    What can begin as a nuisance can quickly escalate to violence. In 
2014, the 2 Las Vegas Metropolitan Police officers referenced earlier 
were murdered by sovereign citizens. After shooting the officers, the 
murderers draped the Gadsden flag \1\ over their bodies with a note to 
``Tell the Police that the revolution has begun.'' In another incident, 
Las Vegas Metropolitan Police infiltrated a plot to kidnap and execute 
police. When testifying on the bill I sponsored, a detective with the 
Las Vegas Metropolitan Police assigned to the Southern Nevada Counter 
Terrorism Center Stated that he and other officers received fake 
indictments and arrest warrants for treason and ``the penalty for 
treason is death.''

Building community relationships and trust helps prevent 
``othering,'' or viewing another group of people as intrinsically 
different than you. It is much more difficult to harm someone you view 
as your neighbor or believe a conspiracy theory about someone you know 
and trust. All of our institutions have a responsibility to foster this 
community building, from civic education in our children's classroom, 
to the media that provides us information about the world, to law 
enforcement and every level of our Government. When we invest the time 
and resources into community building, the results serve us all.
    As part of NAAG, I work with and learn from other Attorneys General 
to tackle tough problems. D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine and current 
president of NAAG has made fighting hate his Presidential Initiative. 
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel shares lessons learned from the 
failed attempt to kidnap and execute Governor Whitmer. Illinois 
Attorney General Kwame Raoul is working with the United States Secret 
Service and Homeland Security to educate communities on how to combat 
hate and terrorism. This program is designed toward prevention and 
education by bringing together community leaders, after-school program 
administrators, volunteer program administrators, hospital staff and 
administrators, community safety and security personnel, mental health 
professionals, and law enforcement. To paraphrase a quote from the 
Bible, ``We don't fight against flesh and blood.'' That is, we do not 
fight against our fellow Americans. We fight against misinformation, 
radicalization, and ignorance. We fight against hate. In doing so, we 
must learn from each other, share information with each other and make 
our communities safer to defeat domestic terrorism.


 As you know, the Proud Boys, the despicable group which I 
have called on our Government to consider designating as 
terrorists, are being charged with conspiracy for their role in 
the January 6 attack on the United States Capitol. The Justice 
Department is also set to be considering sedition charges 
against members of the Oath Keepers, another dangerous militia 
group, which was heavily involved in the attack on the Capitol. 
While I welcome these charges, I am concerned that it has been 
very difficult to win convictions for these charges in the 
past, and a message that might be sent to would-be extremists 
in all of our States.


Ms. Nessel. What we learned in our investigation in 
Michigan is that, you know, subjects who intend to commit 
politically-motivated violence don't always fit into neat 
little boxes. But we know that the motivation behind a 
radicalized person can be complicated and their world view 
doesn't always make sense. So, most of the extremists today 
that we see they often adhere to, you know, conspiracy-based 
theories that are both, you know, White supremacy in nature, 
right-wing extremist ideology agendas. While we have seen left-
wing, I guess, anarchists that sometimes join militias being 
Constitutionalists or libertarian values. More often than not 
what we see is that it is, again, it is race-based, White 
supremacy based, and right-wing based. That has just been our 
experience here in Michigan.


 Our office recognizes that domestic terrorism also includes cyber-
based attacks. These cyber threats, especially those to our critical 
infrastructure, are incredibly concerning. Over the last several years, 
the number of cyber attacks impacting State and local communities has 
escalated. These cyber attacks are a threat to public safety and have 
caused significant disruption to sectors as diverse as health care, 
education, emergency services, and transportation, to name a few.
    The proliferation of significant cyber events has underscored the 
need for better coordination and response capabilities at the State and 
local level, both to thwart attacks and to limit their impact. The 
bottom line is there must be dramatically enhanced coordination across 
sectors that protect our communities' critical infrastructure and 
provide essential services. The Federal Government can assist State and 
local communities by financially supporting these communities' efforts 
at accomplishing 3 primary tasks: (1) Sharing of real-time threat 
information across sectors; (2) training across sectors; and (3) 
developing volunteer response teams to assist sector(s) in need.
    As to the sharing of real-time threat information, New York City 
and the State of Michigan provide 2 models of ensuring that indicators 
of compromise (IoCs) and other relevant cyber attack information are 
moved, without delay, across sectors. The New York City Cyber Critical 
Services and Infrastructure (NYC CCSI), for example, includes cyber 
professionals from 14 sectors who share such relevant data from their 
individual sector to their counterparts in other sectors. Those 
receiving this data can act upon it with dispatch to protect their 
individual entity.
    As to training across sectors, approximately twice a year NYC cyber 
professionals gather to develop and enhance the partnership's 
coordination skills--to conduct cyber emergency fire drills. The threat 
scenarios are not generic; rather, they are developed to closely 
emulate the most current cyber threat landscape facing New York City. 
As a result of the training, both the individual NYC CCSI participant 
and the city are better prepared for future attacks. Finally, as to 
developing cyber response capacity, trained NYC CCSI volunteers are 
prepared to respond to a given sector in crisis, usually following a 
crippling cyber attack. For example, in November 2020, NYC CCSI 
volunteers were called upon and dispatched to a hospital whose servers 
had been locked in a ransomware attack. The NYC CCSI volunteers 
assisted the hospital personnel with getting patient information back 
on-line and accessible to doctors, nurses, and other medical 
professionals.


 As the Nation continues to confront the challenges of home-grown 
terrorism, State and local prosecutors continue to work with our 
Federal partners to hold bad actors accountable. In light of these 
recent tragedies, NDAA and its members have focused our efforts on 
improving training and resources to prepare the field to proactively 
root out domestic terrorism in our communities and combat the spread of 
misinformation. Congress can assist prosecutors and our law enforcement 
partners in this effort by dedicating funding and resources to 
strengthening technical assistant and training as we fight to end the 
spread of domestic terrorism.",Addressing the Rising Threat of Domestic Terrorism,"The passage highlights the increasing threat of domestic terrorism in the United States, exacerbated by extremist rhetoric, political tensions, and the proliferation of disinformation. Recent events such as the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, underscore the urgency of addressing this issue. While there are no specific Federal charges for domestic terrorism, efforts are being made to prosecute perpetrators using existing laws such as conspiracy and sedition. Various states, including Michigan and Nevada, have enacted laws to combat domestic terrorism and provide prosecutors with the necessary tools. Additionally, there is recognition of the need to address cyber-based attacks, with calls for better coordination, training, and response capabilities at the state and local levels. Collaboration between federal, state, and local authorities, along with increased funding and resources, is crucial in combating the spread of domestic terrorism and misinformation."

 The racial justice so many people say they're clamoring for 
cannot be one absent of truth. The healthy diversity that so 
many people say they want reflected in the media cannot be 
built on false narratives and outright lies. We are here today 
to discuss diversity and its ability to make our Union more 
perfect. We can't get there without first discussing our 
abandonment of truth. No truth, no justice. What is standing in 
the way of truth and, therefore, standing in the way of 
holistic diversity? Big Tech and Silicon Valley's hijacking of 
journalism. Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube 
made race clickbait the gold standard of American journalism. 
They are the stewards of fake news.
	 When I graduated from Ball State University in 1990, the 
journalism industry catered to New York liberalism. Thirty 
years later, the industry caters to Northern California 
radicalism and groupthink. Producing work that triggers 
algorithms that lead to likes, retweets, and follows is the 
mandate enforced by media executives. Social media has 
transformed the mainstream media, turning seekers of truth into 
seekers of influence. It's had the same impact on athletes. 
They are no longer role models. They're influence peddlers. 
LeBron James, a basketball prodigy with more than 80 million 
social media followers, has more influence over news coverage

pandemic of police brutality sweeping America's black 
communities. Facts do not support this narrative.


 Mr. Whitlock. Let's say I took your false narrative as 
fact. Let's say I took your false narrative as fact that I 
dabble in right-wing politics. How does that qualify me to talk 
about a movie? I am a sports journalist.

one that you are here to testify about, and I just wanted to 
find out from you whether or not you got anything positive out 
of the Black Panther movie or not.","Big Tech, Media Influence, and Truth in Journalism","The text highlights concerns about Big Tech's influence on journalism, particularly in shaping narratives around racial justice and diversity.

 Specific to COVID-19, the FTC has been very aggressive in 
investigating fraud that originates online. The agency has sent 
hundreds of takedown letters but has not gone after a major 
cause of the problem--negligence by platforms. These platforms 
are not unwitting conspirators, but rather partners-in-profit. 
Platforms must demonstrate real efforts towards keeping 
scammers off the sites. Especially now when Americans are more 
reliant than ever on e-commerce.


  Today we will explore steps we can take to advance our 
fight against fraud and scams, which is so important to--again, 
especially during this pandemic. Millions are forced to isolate 
or remain in their homes, and bad actors continue to exploit 
consumers' fears, their fear and confusion, some promising fake 
reservations for the coronavirus vaccines--again, fake is the 
word that I want to use--stimulus checks, fake loans for small 
businesses struggling to stay afloat, and, of course, we want 
to discuss the Super Bowl tickets. And we are hoping--I am 
hoping that my Tampa Bay Buccaneers will prevail on Sunday.
    Just earlier this year, in my district in Pasco County --I 
represent Pasco, which is the Tampa Bay area, as well as 
Pinellas and Hillsborough Counties--the health departments 
discovered use of a fake Eventbrite website being used to 
charge money for registrations for the COVID vaccine. 
Inexcusable. This fake website was a complete scam, where, as 
we know, vaccine registration is completely free.


In just the first 6 months of 2020, scams originating from 
social media tripled, resulting in 117 million in losses. With 
more consumers tuning in to these platforms, scammers create 
fake profiles offering connection, friendship, or economic 
relief, only to steal information and hard-earned dollars. 
These scams will often come by way of a friend, a friend 
request, and direct messages or advertisements.
    As the FTC continues to publish helpful information on best 
practices, I urge big tech platforms--I urge them to--that they 
should help your users remain vigilant against scams and fraud.
    Bad actors will resort to any means to steal money and 
information. We know that. They will create fake profiles, 
calls from new phone numbers, and even try to mask their 
identity as a friend or family member.

registrations for the COVID vaccine.
    This fake website was a complete scam, for as we know 
vaccine registration is completely free.

 And some of the worst fraudsters are the identity thieves 
stealing stimulus checks and unemployment benefits from those 
already struggling to pay their bills. To make matters worse, 
these people are often targeted for fake employment scams, 
deceptive income schemes, and unwise investment solicitations.


Recently, constituents in my district have been targeted by 
scammers promising COVID-19 vaccinations. I mentioned that in 
my opening comment. Fake Eventbrite websites masking themselves 
as health departments, requiring residents to pay fees for 
appointments to receive the vaccination. This was reported in 
my local paper, the Tampa Bay Times, recently.


Mr. Pallone. All right. And then, just quickly, on social 
media for Ms. Patten or Ms. Rich. We know that, you know, the 
scams on social media have tripled this year, mostly with 
online shopping. And earlier this week, Jan, myself, Anna 
Eshoo, Mike Doyle sent a letter to Facebook, Twitter, and 
Google regarding their handling of COVID vaccine 
misinformation, and how it has escalated on their platforms. 
And obviously, I am concerned about that.


 Ms. Patten. Thank you. I don't think that deceptive and 
false speech that is commercial in nature--and I want to stress 
commercial speech--should be protected. That is the kind of 
speech that is being used to take advantage of susceptible and 
vulnerable populations, especially during this pandemic, to 
steal money from them, steal their identities.


 And, as our witnesses have pointed out, it is just these--
the scams are widespread. Unfortunately, the scam artists are 
all too creative these days. And back home in Tampa I have 
heard from my neighbors about fake COVID cures, and phony 
clinical studies, and even the puppy and romance scams. And 
unfortunately, the FTC has been ineffective because they are 
required to send these toothless warning letters to lawbreaking 
companies. And that is just not going to cut it anymore, in my 
opinion.


 Ms. Patten, many seniors struggle with technology and lack 
of digital literacy skills. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, 
many are now having to rely on the Internet more than ever, 
including for booking COVID-19 vaccine appointments. In some 
States vaccine appointments need to be booked online, leaving 
those who can't navigate the Internet at risk of falling prey 
to fake vaccine appointment websites.


 According to the Florida attorney general office, we have 
seen several rampant themes of scams. Common COVID scams in 
Florida include unsubstantiated disinfectant claims; treatment, 
vaccine, and cure false claims; sham at-home testing kits; 
Federal stimulus scams; fraudulent products; charity scams; 
unsolicited calls, texts, and emails; and phone solicitations. 
The latest scams in Florida, as of this January, are 
vaccination scams, suspicious texts or emails claiming to have 
info about the vaccine in exchange for personal information. 
This is disgraceful.


 From fake stimulus checks to phony pet adoption sites, 
scammers are seizing the opportunities during the pandemic to 
prey on vulnerable Americans. Like Congressman Bucshon, my 
mother and stepfather have had the same problems. Thank God 
they call us and ask us first. Not everybody has that 
opportunity or that luxury.


 Similar to the situation you highlighted in your testimony, 
Ms. Ponto, criminals are gathering personal information from 
websites and social media to apply for benefits in their 
victims' names. I think we talked about the IRS dollars showing 
up on some people's returns. The State uncovered a fake website 
scam that closely mimicked the Indiana Department of Workforce 
Development webpage to trick individuals into giving up their 
information for unemployment. Not only does this result in a 
loss of resources for the State, it is creating significant 
delays in the ongoing verification process for Hoosiers out of 
work and seeking that assistance as quickly as they can get it.


  I want to expand on the conversation in my question to you 
and highlight the work on COVID-19 that I began in the last 
Congress on scams related to COVID-19 with my fellow Minnesota 
Congressman, Pete Stauber. Together we introduced a bill called 
the Stop Coronavirus Scams Act of 2020, which would double the 
applicable forfeiture penalty, criminal fine, and term of 
imprisonment for anyone who provides misleading or inaccurate 
caller information in an attempt to defraud, cause harm, or 
wrongfully obtain anything of value by using false information 
related to COVID-19.
    While this bill primarily deals with the FCC's existing 
authorities under the Communications Act, I wanted to bring it 
up in the context of the comment you made about fraud not 
occurring in a bubble and how it relates to other entities, 
individuals, and systems to function, including the platforms 
and conduits through which scam artists disseminate fraudulent 
information.
    You note in your testimony that among the warning letters 
that the FTC sent regarding COVID-19 scams were letters to 
Voice Over Internet Protocol providers and other companies, 
warning them that routing and transmitting illegal robocalls 
related to COVID-19 is against the law. In one of those joint 
letters sent by the FTC and FCC, the agencies noted that these 
unwanted robocalls included messages alleging that recipients 
have been charged almost $400 for tech support services but may 
receive a refund by responding to the robocall. They also 
included robocalls falsely claiming to come from the United 
States Social Security Administration threatening cutoff of SSA 
benefits.


 Ms. Rich, I want to focus my question on what more the FTC 
can be doing to protect consumers and deter bad behavior by 
fraudsters. And, like my colleague from Minnesota, I was 
compelled by your observation that ``fraud does not happen in a 
bubble, it relies on other systems to function.''
    And this very point was raised by Consumer Reports with the 
FTC last summer in comments about the need for clearer guidance 
on online reviews and endorsements. And they wrote, ``Social 
media sorting algorithms tend to prioritize posts that receive 
more engagement from users with higher followers, providing 
further incentives for marketers to use deceptive tactics to 
augment those numbers.'' I am convinced that they have put 
their finger on the heart of this issue and the broader 
challenge of social media misinformation and disinformation, 
the faulty incentive structures involved in these algorithms.


Now, it was primarily aimed at scams during the pandemic, 
which we have seen: advertised ineffective PPE, we have seen 
advertised false cures and false preventions for the virus. 
That is primarily what was aimed at.",Addressing COVID-19 Fraud and Scams: Calls for Action and Solutions,"The transcript highlights a congressional discussion addressing the surge in COVID-19-related fraud and scams, particularly those originating online. It emphasizes the need for stronger action by platforms and regulatory bodies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to combat fraudulent activities preying on vulnerable consumers during the pandemic. The conversation delves into various types of scams, such as fake vaccine registrations, stimulus check fraud, and misleading online advertisements. Lawmakers express concerns about the effectiveness of current measures, calling for stricter penalties and clearer guidance to protect consumers from falling victim to deceptive practices facilitated by digital platforms and social media algorithms."

unication that is honest and direct in its approach.
     Oklahoma's unique landscape poses a particular set of 
challenges. Many of our community members lack internet access, 
particularly in rural areas with limited reception, or they 
lack digital literacy, particularly in our 65-plus community, 
who are some of the most at risk for COVID-19.
     People in underserved or rural communities have expressed 
higher rates of distrust in vaccines in general. Many people of 
color are wary of vaccines due to a history of medical 
mistreatment. There is a fear of being targeted due to 
immigration status or disclosure of race or ethnicity.
     This is also, of course--there is also, of course, general 
misinformation about COVID-19, leading to skepticism of the 
actual risk posed by COVID-19 or even skepticism that the virus 
exists at all. This misinformation is perpetuated on social 
media where it can have an exaggerated and local influence.
     Our goal with vaccine rollout is to address these concerns 
in a clear and compassionate way. We found that our 
partnerships with local entities have been invaluable in 
contributing to a much smoother rollout process and ensuring 
everyone's health and safety when they receive the vaccine.
     In Oklahoma, our surveys and experiences on the ground 
have shown us that two things are sorely needed: clear, 
accurate information about vaccine safety and efficacy, and 
increase vaccine accessibility to ensure equity.


 In my very brief time with you today, I'd like to expand 
on that report and share some additional insights and evidence 
that can further guide us as we tackle the last-mile challenge 
of getting shots in arms. Here are five science-based solutions 
that I hope Congress can endorse, fund, and promote.
     No. 1, embrace the dual goal of vaccinating efficiently 
and equitably. This recently has been framed as sort of a false 
choice or an either/or with people saying that we can either be 
fast or be fair with vaccine rollout. We have the science to do 
both, but we have to be deliberate, intentional, and innovative 
in our approach to both tracking and achieving those 
complementary goals.


 Dr. Huang. This is Phil Huang. I mean, I'd really say that 
on the ground level, you know, building that trust. But as was 
mentioned, you know, acknowledging the--some of the issues that 
are out there, but trying to be as factual in providing that 
information and addressing, but we're hearing--I mean, you 
know, some of the types of things we're hearing, you know, I 
mean, just--we hear from some people the distrust of 
government, people think we're putting something in the vaccine 
to--the government is putting something in the vaccine to track 
people. They're--you know, they're injecting influenza virus 
into this. A lot of different types of, you know, 
misinformation is out there, again, that the government is 
trying to get more information for undocumented persons, things 
like that. And so we have to acknowledge these but then, you 
know, try to explain in truth.


  Mr. McNerney. Yes, sure. Dr. Huang, you've discussed the 
difficulties faced in reaching and connecting with a variety of 
communities in our cities and States. How do you--how are you 
combating vaccine hesitancy and disinformation with the 
homeless population?
     Dr. Huang. So we have definitely been working with the 
homeless population on testing, dealing with some of the 
outbreak situations. We have a lot of partners. I think what 
has been discussed in particular with them, the Johnson & 
Johnson vaccine may be more amenable for that population. We 
have already been vaccinating those in Texas. It's been--the 
1b's are defined by either 65 years of age or older or 16 to 64 
with an underlying health condition, so we've been trying to do 
those populations within the homeless settings. And, again, 
it's that communication and partnering with the other groups 
that we have that long-standing relationship with them, and 
right now, it's more of a vaccine availability issue.",Addressing Vaccine Hesitancy and Disinformation in Underserved Communities,"The text highlights challenges faced in Oklahoma's vaccine rollout, particularly in rural and underserved areas. These challenges include lack of internet access, digital literacy, and historical distrust in vaccines among certain demographics. To overcome these hurdles, the speaker emphasizes the importance of clear, accurate information and increased vaccine accessibility. Additionally, they propose science-based solutions, such as efficient and equitable vaccination strategies. Dr. Huang discusses combating misinformation among homeless populations by building trust, providing factual information, and leveraging partnerships for vaccine distribution."

 In your time at the Department, you have aided and abetted 
the worst failings of the President. Let us recount just some 
of the decisions that have left us deeply concerned about the 
Department of Justice. First, under your leadership, the 
Department has endangered Americans and violated their 
constitutional rights by flooding Federal law enforcement into 
the streets of American cities, against the wishes of the State 
and local leaders of those cities, to suppress dissent 
forcefully and unconstitutionally. Second, at your direction, 
Department officials have downplayed the effects of systemic 
racism and abandoned the victims of police brutality, refused 
to hold abusive police departments accountable for their 
actions, and expressed open hostility to the Black Lives Matter 
movement. Third, in coordination with the White House, the 
Department has spread disinformation about voter fraud, failed 
to enforce voting rights laws, and attempted to change the 
Census rules to flaunt the plain text of the Constitution, and 
even defied court orders on this subject, all in the apparent 
attempt to assist the President's reelection.
    Fourth, at the President's request, the Department has 
amplified the President's conspiracy theories and shielded him 
from responsibility by blatantly misrepresenting the Mueller 
Report and failing to hold foreign actors accountable for their 
attacks on our elections, undermining both national security 
and the Department's professional staff in the process. Fifth, 
again and again, you personally have interfered with ongoing 
criminal investigations to protect the President and his allies 
from the consequences of their actions. When career 
investigators and prosecutors resisted these brazen, 
unprecedented actions, you replaced them with less-qualified 
staff who appear to be singularly beholden to you.


  How do we know that? How do we know there was no basis? 
They told us. Now, they didn't want to tell us, but thanks to 
Rick Grenell, who released the transcripts of their testimony, 
we now know there was no basis for them to start the 
investigation in the first place. Sally Yates, Ben Rhodes, 
Samantha Powers, Susan Rice. Here is what Susan Rice says: ``I 
don't recall intelligence I would consider evidence of a 
conspiracy.'' How about James Clapper? ``I never saw any direct 
evidence that the Trump Campaign or someone in it was 
conspiring with the Russians to meddle with the election.'' Say 
that again. ``I never saw evidence that the Trump Campaign was 
conspiring,'' and yet they investigated him.
    There was never a proper predicate, so why did they do it? 
There was no reason to do it. Why did they do it? They told us 
that, too. Peter Strzok, August 2015, asked, ``Is Trump going 
to win?'' What is his response? Remember this is Peter Strzok. 
This is the guy who ran the investigation. ``No. No, he is not. 
We will stop it.'' August, Peter Strzok says we will stop 
Trump. September, they spy on Papadopoulos. October, they use 
the fake dossier to lie to the Court. Guess what happens in 
November? Guess what happens in November?


January 4th. The agents investigating Flynn want to drop 
the case. Comey tells them no. January 5th they have the now-
famous meeting in the Oval Office--Obama, Biden, Rice, and 
Comey. All of them are in there. They are plotting their 
strategy, how they are going to get Flynn. January 6th, Comey 
goes up to Trump Tower, briefs President-Elect Trump on the 
dossier that they already know is false just so they could leak 
it to the press and the press will write the story that they 
briefed the President on the dossier. Then, of course, January 
24th is the day they go set up Michael Flynn in his interview.


 Mr. Gohmert. Well, we have heard so much information about 
his basically being the go-between between the DNC, the Clinton 
campaign, Fusion GPS, Christopher Steele, and the Russian 
propaganda that were incorporated into his dossier. I know 
Clinesmith, Christopher Wray indicated he had been given the 
chance to resign, go get a better job. I am wondering how long 
Bruce Ohr is going to be staying where he is? It is incredible 
to me that he is still there.
    Attorney General Barr. Well, I can't talk about individual 
personnel matters.


 Mr. Collins. Okay. As an attorney, and again, looking at 
this with the environment we have right now with police 
officers constantly under attack from this Committee and from 
others and all over the country and especially from the Speaker 
of the House, as an attorney and especially a prosecutor, do 
you think it is appropriate to charge a law enforcement officer 
with a crime as severe as felony murder without giving the 
investigation more than a mere days and without obtaining an 
indictment from the grand jury and, while you announce the 
charges, lay out a case that is full of falsehoods?
    Attorney General Barr. I've said that I would have 
preferred that he had used the grand jury and had waited until 
the Georgia Bureau had completed its investigation.


 I would suggest to you that uncovering the criminal 
conspiracy that existed where people in our own Government were 
trying to convince intelligence agents and operatives around 
the world to destabilize our elections and to discredit our 
President would perhaps be more righteous.


  In February, President Trump falsely claimed that the 
number of coronavirus cases will go from 15 to zero in a few 
days. Was that superb, yes, or no?
    Attorney General Barr. I would have to see the context in 
which it was said.
    Mr. Jeffries. Here is the context. The number of cases 
didn't go down to zero. It is over 4 million.


  Let us move on to May. In that month, on National Nurses 
Day, President Trump falsely called PPE shortages fake news 
while nurses and other health care professionals resorted to 
wearing trash bags and ski goggles to protect themselves. Fake 
news. Was that superb, yes or no?
    Attorney General Barr. I think the Administration did a 
good job of mustering PPE and the national supply of PPE was 
run down during the Obama Administration and never replaced.
    Mr. Jeffries. Thank you, Mr. Barr. The answer is no, it was 
not superb.


    Last question. In July, President Trump falsely claimed 
that 99 percent of COVID-19 cases are, quote, ``totally 
harmless.'' Was that superb, yes or no?
    Attorney General Barr. Essentially, what he was saying is 
that the fatality rate, relatively, is very low. Very low.


Attorney General Barr. Well, first, it's my understanding 
that no tear gas was used on Monday, June 1st.
    Ms. Jayapal. Mr. Barr, that is a semantic distinction that 
has been proven false by many fact-checkers.
    Attorney General Barr. How is it semantic--
    Ms. Jayapal. Do you think--
    Attorney General Barr. How is it semantic? Tear gas is a 
particular compound.
    Ms. Jayapal. You talked about chemical irritants and it has 
been proven false by reports, so just answer the question. Do 
you think it is--
    Attorney General Barr. Well, I think pepper--
    Ms. Jayapal. --appropriate at Lafayette Park to pepper 
spray, tear gas, and beat protesters and injure American 
citizens?


ives and exercising their right to vote.
    The problem that we are facing is that the President has 
repeatedly sought to cast out on the security of mail-in 
ballots, saying that the 2020 election could be rigged with, 
quote, ``millions of mail-in ballots printed by foreign 
countries,'' end quote.
    You, sir, have repeated this disinformation--
    Attorney General Barr. Well, it's not disinformation--
    Ms. Scanlon. Mr. Barr, I don't have a question for you yet. 
Here it comes, though.
    Last month you echoed the President's conspiracy theory 
when you suggested in at least 3 interviews that, quote, 
``Foreign countries could manufacture counterfeit ballots,'' 
end quote, to influence the Presidential election. Correct?
    You did that in at least 3 interviews?
    Attorney General Barr. Yes.


Ms. Scanlon. Well, that tweet suggests, sir, that the 
President is spreading disinformation about mail-in ballots, 
because he is afraid that if more people vote, he and his party 
will lose.
    The fact, Mr. Barr, is that our foreign adversaries cannot 
actually influence our elections by submitting massive 
counterfeit ballots, but the FBI and our intelligence services 
have repeatedly warned that those adversaries are actively 
trying to sow mistrust of our election systems and by repeating 
disinformation about mail-in voting, you and the President are 
helping them.


Which U.S. Attorney have you assigned to receive 
information from Vice-President Biden's personal lawyers 
regarding President Trump?
    Attorney General Barr. Well, maybe if they had vetted the 
dossier--
    Mr. Neguse. There is no--
    Attorney General Barr. --maybe if they had vetted the 
dossier, we wouldn't have--
    Mr. Neguse. There is no U.S. Attorney--
    Attorney General Barr. --the whole--
    Mr. Neguse. Mr. Attorney General, there is no U.S. 
Attorney, of course, that you have appointed to do that 
because--
    Attorney General Barr. What are you talking about?
    Mr. Neguse. --what you have done with respect to this 
process is unprecedented. Now--
    Attorney General Barr. It was cautionary so we do not 
pollute the criminal investigative process with Ukrainian 
disinformation.


 Mr. Stanton. South Carolina and Alabama. You will have a 
chance to comment after your testimony is done here today. The 
American people have good reason to believe that you will 
continue to use your authority to carry out the President's 
wishes to suppress the vote, and there are fears that you and 
the President are laying the foundation to interfere with the 
upcoming election, specifically with vote by mail, as my 
colleagues have previously noted, because both of you have 
advanced false conspiracy theories about mail-in voting. I hope 
we can put some of those fears to rest here today. Mr. Barr, 
can you commit to the American people that you will not 
interfere with the decisions of State and local authorities to 
use vote by mail and absentee ballots in the 2020 elections? 
That is a yes or no question.

 Thanks to my role with the Foreign Affairs Committee, I am 
also aware of the importance of social science in guiding our 
response and actively combating the spread of misinformation 
around infectious disease outbreaks. Fear, anxiety, and stigma 
can drive sick people to hide their symptoms to avoid 
discrimination, prevent some individuals from seeking health 
care immediately, and discourage others from adopting healthy 
behaviors. Integrating social scientists into our outbreak 
response helps communities accept and adhere to public health 
measures aimed at limiting the spread of disease.
    Research and development actions are an integral part of 
the response to an outbreak. Scientists are using innovative 
technologies like artificial intelligence to detect and predict 
the spread of disease more effectively. Others are conducting 
research to optimize the use of currently available treatments 
and evaluate candidates for new drugs and vaccines. It is 
apparent now more than ever that our best scientists should be 
leading our response.
    For the last 14 months, this Committee has worked 
tirelessly to ensure that decision-making is driven by science. 
Now is the time to listen and trust science and use it to react 
calmly and smartly to COVID-19. It is critical that we are not 
swayed by misinformation and avoid the stigmatization of 
vulnerable groups.


 Dr. Sell. Good morning, Vice Chairman Bera, Ranking Member 
Lucas, and members of the Committee. Thank you for inviting me 
to speak about my research on crowd forecasting and 
misinformation, this research, in context of COVID-19, and ways 
to support research that improve outbreak response.


Another area of my research, misinformation during disease 
outbreaks has emerged as a challenge during the COVID-19 
outbreak, and highlights the need to transparently and rapidly 
share information. Health misinformation can be defined as 
false health-related information, and can range from the 
promotion of fake cures to rumors about the origin of the 
outbreak. Misinformation can substantially impede the 
effectiveness of public health response measures, increase 
societal discord, reduce trust in governments, leaders, and 
responders, and increase stigmatization.
     My team and I analyzed misinformation during the 2014 West 
African Ebola outbreak, one of the most recent examples of a 
fear inducing disease event for the U.S. public. Our--in our 
analysis, we found that about 10 percent of the Ebola related 
tweets had false or half true information. We also saw that 
more tweets with misinformation were political, and seemed 
designed to promote discord. Another finding with parallels to 
COVID-19 was the infection--or the identification of rumors, 
often focused on government conspiracies. Although we have 
been--not been able to do a systematic analysis of COVID-19 
misinformation, we have seen the spread of rapid--of false 
information, including recommendations for false cures that 
could be harmful, like drinking chlorine dioxide, blaming 
specific ethnic groups, and conspiracy theories about various 
governments creating the virus as a bioweapon.
     Response to misinformation requires a nuanced approach, 
and further research to best determine the ways forward. While 
the solutions will be complex, one thing that is critical is 
the prevention of an information void that can be filled with 
false information. Members of the public need accurate and 
timely information to help them make sense of what is happening 
in the outbreak. As I advocated for improved disease 
surveillance earlier, this shows the need for a better 
collection and communication of disease information in a 
transparent and rapid manner.


  My bottom line message is this, we need to support the 
systematic collection and rapid dissemination of information 
about outbreaks. The--as the issue of misinformation grows, a 
dedicated effort to understanding the best ways to combat it 
will be needed. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak is over, 
emerging outbreaks will still be a continuing concern. The 
Federal research space needs to evolve toward a more rapid 
approach to meet this threat. Thank you.


 The outbreak of global viruses is often followed by the 
spread of misinformation, especially about how or where the 
virus originated and the government's response to control it. A 
whole country or group of people may be singled out as the 
source of the problem-rather than the pathogen. This is hardly 
a new phenomenon, but the spread of misinformation during this 
current outbreak has been accelerated by social media. The 
World Health Organization has even labeled this outbreak an 
""infodemic,"" meaning there is so much information out there 
that it is hard for people to find trustworthy sources and 
reliable guidance when they need it.
    Given that COVID-19 is a new disease, it is understandable 
that its emergence and spread may cause confusion, anxiety, and 
fear. But if we let these emotions guide us, instead of 
science, we will see the rise of harmful stereotypes that will 
prevent people from accessing the health care they need. We 
have already seen reports of public stigmatization against 
people from areas affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Coupled 
with the health impacts of the virus itself, this is of grave 
concern.
	 According to the World Health Organization, recent disease 
outbreaks like SARS, MERS, Ebola, and Zika have highlighted the 
need to use social science to fight deadly disease outbreaks 
and epidemics. Additional investments in social science 
research on combatting misinformation during outbreaks could 
improve prevention and control efforts and strengthen global 
public health communication. We need a holistic research and 
development response now more than ever.


  Dr. Hotez, you touched on some of your research into 
developing a coronavirus vaccine and, you know, a SARS vaccine. 
I think it's incredibly important since, you know, Dr. Sell 
just talked about information and misinformation, we've heard 
quite a bit about how quick we're going to get a vaccine, how 
quickly that'll be available to the public. And I think just, 
you know, this morning I woke up to a news alert that said a 
Cambridge, Massachusetts biotech company had come up with a 
vaccine that they've sent to Dr. Fauci to start looking at 
testing and so forth. But I think we've got to be honest with 
the public so we don't give them false hope. And, you know, 
perhaps--if you could just go through a timeline on what 
vaccine development is going to look like in the best case 
scenario, then to clinical trials, and then to potential public 
availability?
     Dr. Hotez. Sure. Thank you for that question. So I think 
what we're going to see over the next few weeks to months is 
several vaccines will enter into a pipeline of clinical trials. 
Hopefully ours will be one of them. You mentioned the Moderna 
vaccine out of MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). 
Theirs will--certainly will be in there. Probably Inovio's 
another one. There's about five or six--J&J may have one as 
well. About five or six, maybe a couple more. But then it's 
going to go into a bottleneck, and that bottleneck are the 
clinical trials, phase one, phase two, phase three trials.


Chairman Bera. Exactly. Let me ask Dr. Sell a question. 
You talked about information and misinformation. Based on your 
research as you're observing this, what are some of the common 
misinformation that is out there on COVID-19?
     Dr. Sell. Yeah, so I think that there's a range of 
different misinformation. So there's misinformation about false 
cures, and there aren't any cures right now, so all that is 
false. There's misinformation about sort of government 
conspiracies, that someone else started the disease, and I 
think there's also misinformation about the disease, you know, 
what characteristics it has. I think there's a lot that we 
don't know, and so there's that information void that people 
are just filling with their ideas.


 And you didn't say this part, but I'll say this also, that 
when Washington sees a problem, the habit is to throw billions 
of dollars at it and say, look, now we've done our job, and 
hope for a good result, and move on to the next issue. And, of 
course, there's always the finger pointing and blaming, based 
on, as you well pointed out earlier, much information and 
disinformation. That's really regrettable, and I think the 
American people are getting a little tired of that, but Dr. 
Murray, working with partner agencies you state you've 
successfully identified over 1,200 novel wild-born illnesses, 
including 161 of which belong to the same family as COVID-19. I 
think most of us in the room are wondering what the risk to 
humans is from those viruses as well? I have four related 
questions that I'll ask you after----


  Mr. Cloud. Thank you, Chairman, and thank you all for 
being here to help us address this very important topic. I 
appreciate the healthy discussion over some of the 
misinformation that's come out sometimes with, you know, 
political goals in the dispersion of it. I also appreciate you 
educating us just really on some of the real scientific 
challenges in addressing a situation like this.


 Mr. McNerney. Well, I thank the Chairman, and I thank the 
witnesses this morning. Very useful, informative. Dr. Sell, how 
can social science aid us in understanding how to stop 
misinformation during outbreaks?
     Dr. Sell. So misinformation during outbreaks is a big 
problem, and I think it's a very complex problem. So social 
science could help us understand what the best messages are to 
help people understand when the rumors they're seeing are 
false. So, to improve our messaging, the type of ways we're 
trying to communicate with people, how to convince them of, you 
know, the facts, rather than to believe in these rumors.
     But I also think that there's a--we need to actually 
develop an entire strategy here. We need to think about all the 
different stakeholders, right? We have tech companies, they 
need to be doing work. We have the public. The public--we can't 
just say the public--the public should--we think the public 
should figure out how to determine truth from falsehoods. But 
we also have government, we have news media, and we have public 
health. We all need to think about those stakeholders, and 
everything they can do to deal with this problem.
     Mr. McNerney. Is there a specific area of research that 
would help develop those tools?
     Dr. Sell. I mean, I think that looking into seeing what 
misinformation is out there, and then also the communications 
research that I do. I think that it's looking at what kind of 
ways we can solve that, and the messages that are necessary, so 
that's social science research.


 Dr. Brownstein. So AI is seeing a real explosion in use in 
healthcare. Of course we've seen advancements in other domains, 
financial services, entertainment, but of--what we see is 
there's opportunities in leveraging AI with large datasets. 
When we're dealing with an important event like a public health 
crisis, there's a huge amount of data, a lot of information 
about cases, a lot of misinformation, and being able to sort 
through all that critical data to get important insights that 
we can feed to our modelers, our policymakers, even the public, 
that's where this kind of--these kind of methodologies come 
into play.


  Mr. Casten. Yeah. My concern is just all these people who 
might be needing insulin, might be needing statins, other 
things. Shifting with the little bit of time I have left, Dr. 
Sell, I appreciate your comments on not spreading 
misinformation, and just, with the little time we have left, 
all of us going to be back in our districts next week. We all 
have, you know, certain platforms that we can speak to. Given 
what you researched on Ebola, and without, you know, making 
this a political conversation, as you look at what's going on 
right now, are there specific pieces of misinformation that 
trouble you, and if you were in our shoes, what would you love 
to see us saying to the country this weekend?
     Dr. Sell. You bring up something that's very important, 
because influencers, like you, have the--one of the biggest 
roles in spreading the truth about the disease. That's actually 
borne out by the research. So I think, when you go home to your 
constituents this weekend, I think people might be afraid, and 
I think this is a concerning disease. We can't sugarcoat it. We 
have to say, this is serious, we need to think of it, and think 
about the ways that we can prepare.


Mr. Gonzalez. Thank you. And then, with my final minute, 
Dr. Sell, I want to go back to the question that Mr. Casten was 
asking, with respect to false information. Obviously, since 
2014 and Ebola, the platforms that we use, the way we 
communicate, has changed quite a bit. Have you noticed a stark 
difference of any kind between how misinformation was spread in 
2014 versus how it's spread today? What sort of lessons can we 
learn from that?
     Dr. Sell. This is an opinion without an analysis behind 
it, but I think that the spread of misinformation has been much 
more rapid. We know that in some cases it's been coordinated, 
and I think that it spreads across multiple platforms very 
quickly. We have these echo chambers, and we had echo chambers 
in 2014, but this information just bounces within people who 
have the same belief systems, and so it's very hard to change 
that.


Mr. Beyer. OK. Thank you. Would you say that the World 
Health Organization statistics on the spread of the novel 
coronavirus are false?
     Dr. Sell. No.


 Mr. Beyer. Would you generally agree that all those 
statements are false? The panel. Let me go on--the--Dr. Sell, 
one last question, would you say that it would endanger 
American lives to spread disinformation that would cause people 
to go to work, and potentially spread the coronavirus because 
the public was misled about the dangers of this deadly disease?
     Dr. Sell. Misleading the public about a disease is wrong.


 Mr. Beyer. And, Mr. Chairman, as I yield back, I just want 
to thank Dr. Hotez too for leading the fight against the anti-
vaxxers, and that misinformation.


",Combating Misinformation During Disease Outbreaks: Insights from Experts,"Testimonies and discussions from experts emphasize the crucial role of social science and scientific research in combating misinformation during disease outbreaks, particularly highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Fear, anxiety, and stigma can lead to misinformation, hindering effective outbreak response. Social scientists and researchers advocate for integrating social science into outbreak responses to ensure community acceptance of public health measures. Misinformation, including false cures and government conspiracy theories, can impede public health efforts and increase societal discord. Transparent and rapid sharing of accurate information is crucial to combatting misinformation. Experts stress the need for a nuanced approach and better communication strategies to prevent the spread of false information. Legislators are urged to use their platforms to convey accurate information and combat misinformation, recognizing the importance of scientific facts in guiding public responses to outbreaks."

 The Federal Trade Commission works to protect Americans 
from many unfair and deceptive practices, but a lack of 
resources, authority, and even a lack of will has left many 
American consumers feeling helpless in this digital world. 
Adding to that feeling of helplessness, new technologies are 
increasing the scope and scale of the problem. Deepfakes, 
manipulation of video, dark patterns, bots, and other 
technologies are hurting us in direct and indirect ways.
    Congress has, unfortunately, taken a laissez faire approach 
to regulation of unfair and deceptive practices online over the 
past decade, and platforms have let them flourish. The result 
is Big Tech failed to respond to the grave threats posed by 
deepfakes, as evidenced by Facebook scrambling to announce a 
new policy that strikes me as wholly inadequate--we will talk 
about that later--since it would have done nothing to prevent 
the video of Speaker Pelosi that amassed millions of views and 
prompted no action by the online platform. Hopefully, our 
discussion today can change my mind about that.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS, A 
    REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you. Thank you, Chair Schakowsky. Happy 
New Year, everyone. Welcome to our witnesses. I appreciate the 
chair leading this effort today to highlight online deception.
    I do want to note that last Congress, Chairman Walden also 
held several hearings on platform responsibility. 
Disinformation is not a new problem. It was also an issue 130 
years ago when Joseph Pulitzer and the New York World and 
William Randolph Hearst and The New York Journal led the age 
of, quote, ``yellow journalism.'' Just like clickbait on online 
platforms today, fake and sensational headlines sold newspapers 
and boosted advertising revenue. With far more limited sources 
of information available in the 1890s, the American people lost 
trust in the media. To rebuild trust, newspapers had to clean 
up their act. Now the Pulitzer is associated with something 
very different.
    I believe we are at a similar inflection point today. We 
are losing faith in sources we can trust online. To rebuild it, 
this subcommittee, our witness panel and members of the media 
are putting the spotlight on abuses and deception.
    Our committee's past leadership and constructive debates 
have already led to efforts by platforms to take action. Just 
this week, Facebook announced a new policy to combat deepfakes, 
in part, by utilizing artificial intelligence. I appreciate Ms. 
Bickert for being here to discuss this in greater detail. 
Deepfakes and disinformation can be handled with innovation and 
empowering people with more information.


 The New York Times has reported just last month that China 
is collecting DNA samples and could be using this data to 
create images of faces. Could China be building a tool to 
further track and crack down on minorities and political 
dissidents? Imagine the propaganda and lies it could develop 
with this technology behind the Great Chinese Firewall, where 
there is no free speech or an independent press to hold the 
Communist Party accountable.


 I am also glad that we are putting a spotlight on dark 
patterns. Deceptive laws, fake reviews, and bots are the latest 
version of robocall scams. I am pleased that the FTC has used 
its Section 5 authority to target this fraud and protect 
people. We should get their input as to how we discuss how to 
handle dark patterns.


 Prepared Statement of Hon. Cathy McMorris Rodgers

    Thank you, Chair Schakowsky and welcome to our witnesses.
    I appreciate your work to highlight online deception.
    Last Congress, Chairman Walden led several hearings on 
platform responsibility, before it became the popular cause it 
is today.
    Disinformation is not a new problem.
    It was also an issue 130 years ago when Joseph Pulitzer and 
the New York World and William Randolph Hearst and the New York 
Journal led the age of quote ``yellow journalism.''
    Just like ``clickbait'' on online platforms today, fake and 
sensational headlines sold newspapers and boosted advertising 
revenue.


Just this week Facebook announced a new policy to combat 
deepfakes, in part by utilizing artificial intelligence.
	 I appreciate Ms. Bickert for coming here to discuss this in 
greater detail.
    ``Deepfakes'' and disinformation can be handled with 
innovation and empowering people with MORE information.
    On the platforms they choose and trust, it's a far more 
productive outcome when people can make the best decisions for 
themselves rather than relying on the government to make 
decisions for them.


 Could China be building a tool to further track and crack 
down on minorities and political dissidents?
    Imagine the propaganda and lies they could develop with 
this technology behind the Great Chinese Firewall, where 
there's no free speech or an independent press to hold the 
Communist Party accountable.


  Deceptive ads, fake reviews, and bots are the latest 
version of robocall scams.


 Today, technology has made it difficult, if not impossible, 
for typical consumers to recognize what is real from what is 
fake. And why exactly are people putting so much effort into 
the development and misuse of technology? Because they know 
that trust is the key to influencing and taking advantage of 
people, whether for social, monetary, or political gain. If bad 
actors can make people believe a lie, then they can manipulate 
us into taking actions we wouldn't otherwise take.
    In some instances, we can no longer even trust our eyes. 
Videos can be slowed to make someone appear intoxicated. Faces 
can be Photoshopped onto someone else's body. Audio can be 
edited in a way that a person's words are basically taken out 
of context. And the extent of such manipulation has become 
extreme. Machine-learning algorithms can now create completely 
fake videos, known as deepfakes, that look real. Deepfakes can 
show real people saying or doing things that they never said or 
did.
    For example, face-swapping technology has been used to 
place actor Nicolas Cage into movies where he never was. Actor/
director Jordan Peele created a deepfake supposedly showing 
President Obama insulting President Trump.
    The most common use of deepfakes is nonconsensual 
pornography, which has been used to make it appear as if 
celebrities have been videotaped in compromising positions. And 
deepfake technology was also used to humiliate a journalist 
from India who was reporting on an 8-year-old rape victim.
    Advances in algorithms are also behind the glut of social 
media bots, automated systems that interact on social media as 
if they were real people. These bots are used by companies and 
other entities to build popularity of brands and respond to 
consumer service requests. Even more alarming is the use of 
these bots by both state and nonstate actors to spread 
disinformation, which can influence the very fabric of our 
society and our politics.


 Unrelenting advances in these technologies and their abuse 
raise significant questions for all of us. What is the 
prevalence of these deceptive techniques? How are these 
techniques actually affecting our actions and decisions? What 
steps are companies and regulators taking to mitigate consumer 
fraud and misinformation?
    So I look forward to beginning to answer these questions 
with our expert witness panel today so we can start to provide 
more transparency and tools for consumers to fight 
misinformation and deceptive practices.


 Online actors, including nation-states, companies, and 
individual fraudsters, are using online tools to manipulate and 
deceive Americans. While some methods of deception are well 
known, many are new and sophisticated, fooling even the most 
savvy consumers. Today, technology has made it difficult, if 
not impossible, for typical consumers to recognize what's real 
from what's fake.
    And why exactly are people putting so much effort into the 
development and misuse of this technology? Because they know 
that trust is the key to influencing and taking advantage of 
people. Whether for social, monetary, or political gain, if bad 
actors can make people believe a lie, they can manipulate us 
into taking actions we wouldn't otherwise take.
    In some instances, we can no longer even trust our eyes.

other entities to build popularity of brands and respond to 
customer service requests. Even more alarming is the use of 
these bots by both state and nonstate actors to spread 
disinformation, which can influence the very fabric of our 
societies and our politics.

raise significant questions for all of us. What is the 
prevalence of these deceptive techniques? How are these 
techniques actually affecting our actions and decisions? What

fraud and misinformation?
    I look forward to beginning to answer these questions with 
our expert witness panel today so that we can start to provide

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GREG WALDEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
               CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OREGON

    Mr. Walden. Good morning, Madam Chair. Thanks for having 
this hearing and welcome everyone in. I guess this is the 
second hearing of the new year. There is one that started 
earlier upstairs, but we welcome you all to hear this important 
topic and glad to hear from our witnesses today, even those who 
I am told have health issues this morning, but thanks for being 
here.
    As with anything, the internet presents bad actors with 
those seeking to harm others some ample opportunities to 
manipulate the users and take advantage of consumers, which 
often tend to be some of the most vulnerable in the population. 
Arguably, the digital ecosystem is such that harmful acts are 
easily exacerbated, and as we all know, false information or 
fake videos spread at breakneck speeds.
    That is why, when I was chairman of this committee, we 
tried to tackle this whole issue with platform responsibility 
head on, and we appreciate the input we got from many. Last 
Congress, we, as you heard, held hearings and legislated on 
online platforms not fulfilling their Good Samaritan 
obligations, especially when it comes to online human 
trafficking.
    Companies' use of algorithms and the impact such algorithms 
have on influencing consumer behavior, we took a look at that. 
Improving/expanding the reach of broadband services so rural 
and urban consumers of all ages can benefit in a connected 
world from the positive aspects of the internet. Explaining the 
online advertising ecosystem, preservation and promotion across 
border data flows, a topic we need to continue to work on. 
Other related issues we face in the connected world, such as 
cybersecurity, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, to 
name just a few.


 Also notable, through the Global Internet Forum to Counter 
Terrorism, platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube 
have been working together to tackle terrorist content and, 
importantly, disrupt violent extremists' ability to promote 
themselves, share propaganda, and exploit digital platforms. 
And we thank you for that work.


 And then speaking of revise, I had to chuckle that we all 
get the opportunity to revise and extend our remarks throughout 
this process and clean up our bad grammar. So maybe some of 
what we have is kind of fake reporting, but anyway, we will 
leave that for another discussion on another day.


 But, as with anything, the internet presents bad actors and 
those seeking to harm others ample opportunities to manipulate 
users and take advantage of consumers, which often tend to be 
some of our most vulnerable populations. Arguably, the digital 
ecosystem is such that harmful acts are easily exacerbated and, 
as we all know, false information or fake videos spread at 
breakneck speeds. That is why when I was chairman of this 
committee, we tackled platform responsibility head-on.


 Also notable--through the Global Internet Forum to Counter 
Terrorism--platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube 
have been working together to tackle terrorist content and, 
importantly, disrupt violent extremists' ability to promote 
themselves, share propaganda, and exploit digital platforms.


 We know that we have an important role to play at Facebook 
in addressing manipulation and deception on our platform. And 
we have many aspects to our approach, including our community 
standards, which specify what we will remove from the site, and 
our relationship with third-party fact checkers, through which 
fact-checking organizations can rate content as false. We put a 
label over that content saying that this is false information, 
and we reduce its distribution.
    Under the community standards, there are some types of 
misinformation that we remove, such as attempts to suppress the 
vote or to interfere with the Census. And we announced 
yesterday a new prong in our policy where we will also remove 
videos that are edited or synthesized, using artificial 
intelligence, or deep learning techniques, in ways that are not 
apparent to the average person that would mislead the average 
person to believe that the subject of the video said something 
that he or she did not, in fact, say.
    To be clear, manipulated media that doesn't fall under this 
new policy definition is still subject to our other policies 
and our third-party fact checking. That means that deepfakes 
are still an emerging technology. One area where internet 
experts have seen them is in nudity and pornography. All of 
that violates our policies against nudity and pornography, and 
we would remove it. Manipulated videos are also eligible to be 
fact-checked by these third-party fact-checking organizations 
that we work with to label and reduce the distribution of 
misinformation.


 My research team tracks dangerous individuals and groups 
who use social media to pose as political campaigns, social 
movements, news organizations, charities, brands and even 
average people. This emerging economy of misinformation is a 
threat to national security. Silicon Valley corporations are 
largely profiting from it, while key political and social 
institutions are struggling to win back the public's trust.
    Platforms have done more than just given users a voice 
online. They have effectively given them the equivalent of 
their own broadcast station, emboldening the most malicious 
among us. To wreak havoc with a media manipulation campaign, 
all one bad actor needs is motivation. Money also helps. But 
that is enough to create chaos and divert significant resources 
from civil society, politicians, newsrooms, healthcare 
providers, and even law enforcement, who are tasked with 
repairing the damage. We currently do not know the true cost of 
misinformation.
    Individuals and groups can quickly weaponize social media, 
causing others financial and physical injury. For example, 
fraudsters using President Trump's image, name, logo and voice 
have siphoned millions from his supporters by claiming to be 
part of his reelection coalition. In an election year, 
disinformation and donation scams should be of concern to 
everyone. Along with my coresearchers Brian Friedberg and 
Brandi Collins-Dexter, I have studied malicious groups, 
particularly white supremacists and foreign actors, who have 
used social media to inflame racial divisions. Even as these 
imposters are quickly identified by the communities they 
target, it takes time for platforms to remove inciting content. 
A single manipulation campaign can create an incredible strain 
on breaking news cycles, effectively turning many journalists 
into unpaid content moderators and drawing law enforcement 
towards false leads.
	Today, I argue that online communication technologies need 
regulatory guardrails to prevent them from being used for 
manipulative purposes. And in my written testimony, I have 
provided a longer list of ways that you could think about 
technology differently.
    But right now, I would like to call attention to 
deceptively edited audio and video to drive clicks, likes, and 
shares. This is the AI technology commonly referred to as 
deepfakes. And what I would also like to point out, with my 
coresearcher Britt Paris, that we have argued that cheapfakes 
are a wider threat. Like the doctored video of Speaker Pelosi, 
last week's decontextualized video of Joe Biden seemingly 
endorsing a white supremacist talking point poses another 
substantial challenge. Because the Biden video was clipped from 
nonaugmented footage, platforms refused to take down this 
cheapfake. Millions have now seen it.


 I think there is--the thing I most want to respond to here 
is we often frame these issues as we have got a few bad apples. 
We have got these bad deepfakes, we have got to get them off 
the platform. We have got this bad content. We have got these 
bad bots. What I want to argue is this is actually--and we have 
got these dark patterns.


There is a recent Upturn study that it actually costs more 
money to advertise across the aisle than it does to advertise 
to people with your own same beliefs. In other words, 
polarization has a home field advantage in terms of the 
business model. The natural function of these platforms is to 
reward conspiracy theories, outrage, what we call the race to 
the bottom of the brainstem. It is the reason why all of you at 
home have crazier and crazier constituents who believe crazier 
and crazier things, and you have to respond to them. I know you 
don't like that.
    Russia is manipulating our veterans by--we have totally 
open borders. While we have been protecting our physical 
borders, we left the digital border wide open. Imagine a 
nuclear plant and you said we are not going to actually protect 
the nuclear plants from Russian cyber attacks. Well, this is 
sort of like Facebook building the information infrastructure 
and not protecting it from any bad actors until that pressure 
is there.
    And this is leading to a kind of information trust 
meltdown, because no one even has to use deepfakes for 
essentially people to say, ``Well, that must be a faked video, 
right?'' So we are actually at the last turning point, kind of 
an event horizon, where we either protect the foundations of 
our information and trust environment or we let it go away.


 Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you.
    So now we have concluded our witnesses' opening statements. 
At this time, we will move to Member questions. Each Member 
will have 5 minutes to ask a question of our witnesses. I will 
begin by recognizing myself for 5 minutes.
    So, as chair of the subcommittee, over and over again I am 
confronted with new evidence that Big Tech has failed in 
regulating itself. When we had Mark Zuckerberg here, I kind of 
did a review of all the apologies that we have had from him 
over the years, and I am concerned that Facebook's latest 
effort to address misinformation on the platforms leaves a lot 
out.
    I want to begin with some questions of you, Ms. Bickert. So 
the deepfakes policy only covers video, as I understand it, 
that has been manipulated using artificial intelligence, or 
deep learning. Is that correct?
    Ms. Bickert. Thank you, Chairwoman Schakowsky. The policy 
that we announced yesterday is confined to the definition that 
we set forth about artificial intelligence being used in a 
video to make it appear that somebody is saying something----
    Ms. Schakowsky. I only have 5 minutes. So the video, for 
example, of Speaker Pelosi was edited to make her look like she 
was drunk, wouldn't have been taken down under the new policy. 
Is that right, yes or no?
    Ms. Bickert. It would not fall under that policy, but it 
would still be subject to our other policies that address 
misinformation.
    Ms. Schakowsky. And, as I read the deepfakes policy, it 
only covers video where a person is made to appear like they 
said words that they didn't actually say, but it doesn't cover 
videos where just the image is altered. Is that true?
    Ms. Bickert. Chairwoman Schakowsky, that is correct about 
that policy. We do have a broader approach to misinformation 
that would put a label--we would actually obscure the image and 
put a screen over it that says ``false information,'' and 
directs people to information from fact checkers.
	  Ms. Schakowsky. So, Ms. Bickert, I really don't understand 
why Facebook should treat fake audio differently from fake 
images. Both can be highly misleading and result in significant 
harm to individuals and undermine democratic institutions.
    Dr. Donovan, in your testimony, you noted that, quote, 
``cheapfakes,'' unquote, are more prevalent than deepfakes. Do 
you see any reason to treat deepfakes and cheapfakes 
differently?
    Dr. Donovan. One of the things----
    Ms. Schakowsky. Microphone.
    Dr. Donovan. Of course, as if I am not loud enough.
    One of the things that cheapfakes leverage is what is sort 
of great about social media, is that it makes things clippier, 
or smaller. And so I understand the need for separate policies, 
but also the cheapfakes issue has not been enforced. Speaking 
more broadly about social media platforms in general, there is 
completely uneven enforcement.
    So you can still find that piece of misinformation within 
the wrong context in multiple places. And so the policy on 
deepfakes is both narrow--and I understand why--but also, one 
thing that we should understand is presently there is no 
consistent detection mechanism for even finding deepfakes at 
this point. And so I would be interested to know more about how 
they are going to seek out, either on upload, not just 
Facebook----
    Ms. Schakowsky. I am going to have to cut you off at this 
point, because I do want to ask Mr. Harris.
    Given the prevalence of deceptive content online, are 
platforms doing enough to stop the dissemination of 
misinformation, and what can government do to prevent such 
manipulation of consumers? Should government be seeking to 
clarify the principle that if it is illegal offline then it is 
illegal online?
    Mr. Harris. Yes. A good example of that--so first is no, 
the platforms are not doing enough, and it is because their 
entire business model is misaligned with solving the problem. 
And I don't vilify the people because of that. It is just their 
business model is against the issue.


king member, for 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    I referenced how misinformation is not a new problem, but 
certainly with the speed of information, how it can travel in 
the online world, its harm is increasing. That said, I have 
long believed that the way to address information is more 
transparency, more sources, more speech, not less. This is 
important, not just in an election cycle, but also in 
discussions around public health issues, natural disasters, or 
any number of significant events. I am worried about this 
renewed trend, where some want the government to set the 
parameters and potentially limit speech and expression.
    Ms. Bickert, how does free speech and expression factor 
into Facebook's content decisions, and can you please explain 
your use of third-party fact checkers?
    Ms. Bickert. Thank you. We are very much a platform for 
free expression. It is one of the reasons that we work with 
third-party fact-checking organizations, because what we do if 
they have ranked something false is, we share more information 
on the service. So we put a label over it, this is false 
information, but then we show people here is what fact checkers 
are saying about this story.
	 We work with more than 50 organizations worldwide, and 
those organizations are chosen after meeting high standards for 
fact checking.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you. As a followup, with the total 
volume of traffic you have, clearly human eyes alone can't keep 
up. So artificial intelligence and machine learning have a 
significant role to identify not only deepfakes but also other 
content that violates your terms of service. Would you just 
explain a little bit more to us how you use AI and the 
potential to use AI to fight fire with fire?
    Ms. Bickert. Absolutely. We do use a combination of 
technology, and people to identify potential information to 
send to fact checkers. We also use people and technology to try 
to assess whether or not something has been manipulated, media. 
That would be covered by the policy we released yesterday.
    So, with the fact-checking program, we use technology to 
look for things like--let's say somebody has shared an image or 
a news story and people are--friends are commenting on that, 
saying, ``Don't you know this is a hoax?'' or ``This isn't 
true.'' That is the sort of thing our technology can spot and 
send that content over to fact-checkers.
    But it is not just technology. We also have ways for people 
to flag if they are seeing something that they believe to be 
false. That can send content over to fact checkers. And then 
the fact checkers can also proactively choose to rate something 
that they are seeing on Facebook.


 Mr. Hurwitz. Yes, very briefly. I could lecture for a 
semester on this, not to say that I have.
    The FTC has a broad history, long history of regulating 
unfair and deceptive practices and advertising practices. Its 
deception authority--false statements, statements that are 
material to a consumer, making a decision that is harmful to 
the consumer. They can use adjudication. They can enact rules 
in order to take action against platforms or any entity, online 
or offline, that deceives consumers.


 We have heard about user interfaces designed to persuade 
and sometimes trick people into making certain choices, 
deepfakes and cheapfakes, that show fictional scenarios that 
look real, and algorithms designed to keep people's eyes locked 
on their screens. And we know these things are happening. But 
what is less clear is how and the extent to which these 
techniques are being used commercially and on commercial 
platforms.
    So first let me ask Dr. Donovan: As a researcher who 
focuses on the use of these techniques, do you have sufficient 
access to commercial platform data to have a comprehensive 
understanding of how disinformation and fraud is conducted and 
by whom?
    Dr. Donovan. The brief answer is no, and that is because we 
don't have access to the data as it is. There are all these 
limits on the ways in which you can acquire data through the 
interface.


 Mr. Pallone. Thank you. This week, Facebook released a new 
policy on how it will handle deepfakes. So, Ms. Bickert, under 
your policy deepfakes are--and I am paraphrasing--videos 
manipulated through artificial intelligence that are intended 
to mislead and are not parody or satire. Did I get that right?
    Ms. Bickert. Yes, that is right.
    Mr. Pallone. OK. Now, I understand that Twitter and YouTube 
either do not have or use the same definition for deepfakes, 
and that is indicative of a lack of consistent treatment of 
problematic content across the major platforms. Banned hate 
speech or abusive behavior on one site is permitted on another. 
There seems to be very little consistency across the 
marketplace, which leaves consumers at a loss.


 I appreciate the hearing and the opportunity to discuss the 
spread of misinformation on the internet, but I want to stress 
that I am concerned over the efforts to make tech companies the 
adjudicators of ``truth,'' in quotation marks.
    In a country founded on free speech, we should not be 
allowing private corporations, in my view, or, for that matter, 
the government to determine what qualifies as, again in 
quotation marks, the ``truth,'' potentially censoring a voice 
because that voice disagrees with a mainstream opinion. That 
said, I totally understand the difficulty and the challenges 
that we all face together concerning this issue, and how we 
are, together, trying to work to address it.
    Ms. Bickert, can you provide some more information on how 
Facebook might or will determine if a video misleads? What 
factors might you consider?
    Ms. Bickert. Thank you. Just to be clear, there are two 
ways that we might be looking at that issue. One is with regard 
to the deepfakes policy that we released yesterday. And we will 
be looking to see, specifically, were we seeing artificial 
intelligence and deep learning? Was that part of the technology 
that led to change or fabricate a video in a way that really 
wouldn't be evident to the average person? And that will be a 
fundamental part of determining whether there is misleading.


 Mr. Bucshon. And I appreciate what you are doing. I am not 
trying to be difficult here.
    Ms. Bickert. No, these are real challenging issues. It is 
one of the reasons that we think, generally, the approach to 
misinformation of getting more information out there from 
accurate sources is effective.
    Mr. Bucshon. And you stated in your testimony that, once a 
fact checker rates a photo or video as false, or partly false, 
Facebook reduces the distribution. Is there a way for an 
individual who may have posted these things to protest the 
decision?
    Ms. Bickert. Yes, Congressman. They can go directly to the 
fact checker. We make sure there is a mechanism for that. And 
they can do that either if they dispute it or if they have 
amended whatever it was in their article that was the problem.


 And now, what we have swamping these online platforms that 
control the algorithms that manipulate the public are the 
deepfakes, these dark patterns, artificial intelligence, 
identity theft. But these online platforms, remember, they 
control these algorithms that steer children and adults, 
everyone in certain directions, and we have got to get a handle 
on that.
    For example, Mr. Harris, one manipulative design technique 
is the autoplay feature. It is now ubiquitous across video 
streaming platforms, particularly billions of people that go 
onto YouTube or Facebook. This feature automatically begins 
playing a new video after the current video ends. The next 
video is determined using an algorithm. It is designed to keep 
the viewer's attention.
    This platform-driven algorithm often drives the 
proliferation of illegal activities and dangerous ideologies 
and conspiracy theories. It makes it much more difficult for 
the average person to try to get truth-based content.


The quick example is, imagine a spectrum of all the videos 
on YouTube laid out in one line, and on my left side over here, 
you have the calm Walter Cronkite, rational science side of 
YouTube, and the other side you have Crazy Town. You have UFOs, 
conspiracy theories, Alex Jones, crazy stuff.
    No matter where you start on YouTube, you could start in 
the calm section or you could start in crazy. If I want you to 
watch more, am I going to steer you that way or that way? I am 
always going to steer you towards Crazy Town. So imagine taking 
the ant colony of 2.1 billion humans and then just tilting it 
like that.
    Three examples of that per your kids example: 2 years ago 
on YouTube, if a teen girl watched a dieting video, it would 
autoplay anorexia videos, because those were more extreme. If 
you watched a 9/11 news video, it would recommend 9/11 
conspiracy theories. If you watched videos about the moon 
landing, it would recommend flat Earth conspiracy theories.
    Flat earth conspiracy theories were recommended hundreds of 
millions of times. This might sound just funny and, ``Oh, look 
at those people,'' but actually this is very serious. I have a 
researcher friend who studied this. If the flat Earth theory is 
true, it means not just that all of government is lying to you, 
but all of science is lying to you. So think about that for a 
second. That is like a meltdown of all of our rational 
epistemic understanding of the world.


 Ms. Castor. This has significant cost to the public, and 
that is one of the points I hope people will understand. As Dr. 
Donovan says, there is economy of misinformation now. These 
online platforms now are passing along--they are monetizing, 
making billions of dollars. Meanwhile, public health costs, law 
enforcement costs are adding up to the public, and we have a 
real responsibility to tackle this and level the playing field.
    Mr. Harris. And by not acting, we are subsidizing our 
societal self-destruction. I mean, we are subsidizing that 
right now. So yes, absolutely. Thank you so much.


 Mr. Hurwitz, let me start by asking you--and this is a 
little bit off topic, but it is important. In 2018, United 
States District Court for Western Pennsylvania indicted seven 
Russians for conducting a physical cyber hacking operation in 
2016 against Western targets, including the United States Anti-
Doping Agency, in response to the revelation of Russia's state-
sponsored doping campaign. These hackers were representatives 
of the Russian military, the GRU. According to the indictment, 
the stolen information was publicized by the GRU as part of a 
related influence and disinformation campaign designed to 
undermine the legitimate interests of the victims. This 
information included personal medical information about United 
States athletes.
    So these GRU hackers used fictitious identities and fake 
social media accounts to research and probe victims and their 
computer networks. While the methods we are talking about today 
are largely in the context of perhaps deceiving voters or 
consumers, the harmful potential effects is actually quite 
large.


One example that I will highlight that goes to an industry-
based solution and, more important, the nature of how we need 
to think about these things differently, in the context of 
targeted advertising and political advertising in particular, 
how do we deal with targeted misinformation for political ads?
    Well, one approach which Facebook has been experimenting 
with is, instead of saying you can't speak, you can't 
advertise, if I target an ad at a group of speakers, Facebook 
will let someone else target an ad to that same group, or they 
have been experimenting with this.


  Ms. Bickert. Yes, Congressman. And thank you for those 
words. We are concerned not just with misinformation--that is a 
concern, and that is why we developed the relationships we have 
now with more than 50 fact-checking organizations--but we are 
also concerned with abuse of any type. I am responsible for 
managing that, so whether it is terror propaganda, hate speech, 
threats of violence, child exploitation content, content that 
promotes eating disorders. Any of that violates our policies, 
and we go after it proactively to try to find it and remove it. 
That is what my team is.


   So right now, every single week, we hear reports of Saudi 
Arabia, Iran, Israel, China, Russia, all doing various 
different influence operations. Russia was recently going after 
U.S. veterans. Many veterans would probably say that is a 
conspiracy theory, right? But Facebook is the company that 
knows exactly who was affected, and they could actually back-
notify every time there is an influence operation, letting 
those communities know that this is what happened, and that 
they were targeted.
    We have to move from ``This is a conspiracy theory'' to 
``This is real.'' I have studied cult deprogramming for a 
while, and how do you wake people up from a cult when they 
don't know they are in? You have to show them essentially the 
techniques that were used on them to manipulate them. And every 
single time these operations happen, I think that has to be 
made visible to people.


 So, you know, you can just make some benchmarks and say, 
``Are they solving the problem?'' They have got 2.2 billion 
fake accounts, Facebook has, that they took down, fake 
accounts. So they have 2.7 billion real accounts, and then 
there were 2.2 billion fake accounts. And, you know, I am sure 
they got all of them I think would be the line to use here.
    Mr. Veasey. Ms. Bickert, you know, given the fact that it 
does seem like these foreign agents, these foreign actors, are 
targeting people specifically by their race, by their 
economics, by what region of the country that they live in, is 
Facebook doing anything to gather information or to look at how 
specific groups are being targeted?
    If African Americans are being targeted for political 
misinformation, if whites that live in rural America, if they 
are being targeted for political misinformation, if people 
based on their likes--like, if you could gatherinformation, if 
these foreign actors could gather information based on people 
based on things that they like.
    So let's say that you were white and you lived in rural 
America and you liked One America News and you like these other 
things and you may be more likely to believe in these sorts of 
conspiracy theories. Are you sure that some of the things that 
people are sharing on your platform, the likes and dislikes, 
aren't being used as part of that scheme as well?
    Could you answer both of those?
    Ms. Bickert. Yes, Congressman. Thank you for the question. 
There are, broadly speaking, two things that we do. One is 
trainings and tools to help people--especially those who might 
be most at risk--recognize ways to keep themselves safe from 
everything from hacking to scams and other abuse.
    Separately, whenever we remove influence operations under 
our, what we call this coordinated inauthentic behavior--we 
have removed more than 50 such networks in the past year--any 
time we do that, we are very public about it, because we want 
to expose exactly what we are seeing. And we will even include 
examples in our post saying, here is a network, it was in this 
country, it was targeting people in this other country, here 
are examples of the types of posts that they were putting in 
their pages. We think the more we can shine a light on this, 
the more we will be able to stop it.


  Congress recognized that many of these scams were carried 
out through the use of manipulative and illegal robocalls. To 
combat these scams, I introduced the STOP Robocalls Act, which 
was recently signed into law as part of the tray stack, which I 
am very glad the President signed over the Christmas holiday.
    While I am glad that we were able to get this done, I 
continue to be concerned with the ability of scammers to evolve 
and adapt to changes in the law by utilizing new technologies 
and techniques like deep- and cheapfakes.
    And, Ms. Bickert, I don't want to pick on you, and I truly 
appreciate you being here today, especially since you are a 
little under the weather. And I also appreciated reading your 
testimony last night. I found it very interesting and 
enlightening.
    I have several questions. As more and more seniors are 
going online and joining Facebook to keep in contact with their 
family, friends, and neighbors, in your testimony, you walk us 
through Facebook's efforts to recognize misinformation and what 
the company is doing to combat malicious actors using 
manipulated media. Is Facebook doing anything specifically to 
help protect seniors from being targeted on the platform, or 
educating them on how to recognize fake accounts or scams?
    Ms. Bickert. Thank you for the question. We are, indeed. 
And that includes both in-person trainings for seniors, which 
we have done and will continue to do. We also have a guide that 
can be more broadly distributed that is publicly available that 
is a guide for seniors on the best ways to keep themselves 
safe.


 We could see dangerous consequences if the right tools are 
not in place to prevent the spread of misinformation online. 
This is a national security concern. As a former law 
enforcement officer, I understand that laws can be meaningless 
if they are not enforced. I look forward to hearing more from 
our witnesses about the FTC's capabilities and resources to 
combat these deceptive online practices.
    Dr. Donovan, in your testimony you say that regulatory 
guardrails are needed to protect users from being misled 
online. I share your concerns about deception and manipulation 
online, including the rise in use of the dark patterns, 
deepfakes and other kinds of bad practices that can harm 
consumers.
    Can you explain in more detail what sort of regulatory 
guardrails are necessary to prevent these instances?
    Dr. Donovan. I will go into one very briefly. One of the 
big questions is, if I post something online that is not an 
advertisement, you know, I am just trying to inform my known 
networks. The problem isn't necessarily always that there is a 
piece of fake content out there. The real problem is the scale, 
being able to reach millions.
	  In 2010, 2011, we lauded that as a virtue of platforms. It 
really emboldened many of our important social movements and 
raised some incredibly important issues. But that wasn't false 
information. It wasn't meant to deceive people. It wasn't meant 
to siphon money out of other groups. At that time too, you 
weren't really able to scale donations. It was much harder to 
create networks of fake accounts and pretend to be an entire 
constituency.
    And so, when I talk about regulatory guardrails, we have to 
think about distribution differently than we think about the 
content. And then we can also assuage some of the fears that we 
have about freedom of expression by looking at what are the 
mechanisms by which people can break out of their known 
networks? Is it advertising? Is it the use of fake accounts? 
How are people going viral? How are posts going viral, 
information going viral?


 Mr. Carter. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    And thank all of you for being here. This is extremely 
important, and extremely important to all of our citizens.
    I want to start by saying that, you know, when we talk 
about deepfake and cheapfake, to me, that is somewhat black and 
white. I can understand it. But, Mr. Hurwitz, when we talk 
about dark patterns, I think that is more gray in my mind. And 
I will just give you an example.
    I was a retailer for many years. And I grew up in the 
South, OK? We had a grocery store chain, some of you may be 
familiar with it: Piggly Wiggly. Now, I always heard that the 
way they got their name--and I tried to fact-check it, but I 
couldn't find it, but anyway--I always heard the way they got 
their name is they arranged their stores to when you went in 
you had to kind of wiggle all the way around before you could 
get back out so that you would buy more things. It was like a 
pig wiggling through the farmyard or something. And they came 
up with Piggly Wiggly. Well, that is marketing.
    And, you know, another example is all of us go to the 
grocery store. When we are at the grocery store and you are in 
the checkout line, you got all these things up there that they 
are trying to get you to buy. They are not necessarily--you 
could argue that they are impulse items. But then again, you 
could also make the argument that when you get home you say, 
``Geez, I wish I had gotten that at the grocery store. I wish I 
would have gotten these batteries or Band-Aids'' or whatever.
    How do you differentiate between what is harmful and what 
is beneficial?
    Mr. Hurwitz. A great question, because it is gray. And, as 
I said previously, dark patterns, the term itself is a dark 
pattern intended to make us think about this as dark. There are 
some clear categories, clear lies, clear false statements, 
where we are talking about classic deception. That is pretty 
straightforward.


 Mr. Hurwitz. Mr. Harris used the example earlier of what if 
autoplay is shifting us towards conspiracy theories. OK, that 
is a dark pattern, that is bad. What if, instead, it was using 
us to shift us the other way, to the light, to greater 
education. If we say autoplay is bad, then we are taking both 
of those options off the table.
    This can be used for good, and the question that you asked 
about how do we differentiate between good uses and bad, that 
is the question.
    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Madam Chair. I yield back.
    Ms. Schakowsky. Mr. Cardenas is recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Cardenas. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you so much 
for holding this very important hearing that, unfortunately, I 
think most Americans don't understand how important this is to 
every single one of us, especially to our children and future 
generations.
    There is an app, TikTok, question mark. Is it a deepfake 
maker? Five days ago, TechCrunch reported that ByteDance, the 
parent company of the popular video-sharing app TikTok, may 
have secretly built a deepfake maker. Although there is no 
indication that TikTok intends to actually introduce this 
feature, the prospect of deepfake technology being made 
available on such a massive scale and on a platform that is so 
popular with kids raises a number of troubling questions.
    So my question to you, Mr. Harris, is in your testimony you 
discuss at length the multitude of ways that children are 
harmed by new technology. Can you talk about why this news may 
be concerning?
    Mr. Harris. Yes. Thank you for the question.
    So deepfakes is a really complex issue. I think if you look 
at how other governments are responding to this--I don't mean 
to look at China for legal guidance, but they see this as so 
threatening to their society, the fabric of truth and trust in 
their society, that if you post a deepfake without labeling it 
clearly as a deepfake, you can actually go to jail.
    So they are not saying if you post a deepfake you go to 
jail. They are saying if you post it without labeling it, you 
go to jail. You can imagine a world where Facebook says, ``If 
you post a deepfake without labeling it, we actually maybe 
suspend your account for 24 hours, so that you sort of feel--
and we label your account to other people who see your 
account----''
    Mr. Cardenas. Hold on a second. My colleague on the other 
side of the aisle just warned, quote, ``And you want to have 
the government control this?'' You just gave an example of 
where private industry could, in fact, create deterrents----
    Mr. Harris. That is right.
    

   I want to start with deepfakes and cheap fakes. We know 
through New York Times v. Sullivan that defamation of public 
figures requires actual malice. And some of these just appear 
to be malicious on their face.
    I appreciate the labeling, Ms. Bickert, that Facebook is 
doing now. That is something that we actually were pondering in 
our office as well. But why wouldn't Facebook simply just take 
down the fake Pelosi video?
    Ms. Bickert. Thank you for the question.
    Our approach is to give people more information so that, if 
something is going to be in the public discourse, they will 
know how to assess it, how to contextualize it. That is why we 
work with the fact checkers.
    I will say that in the past 6 months it is feedback from 
academics and civil society groups that has led us to come up 
with stronger warning screens.
    Mr. Soto. Would that be labeled under your current policy 
now as false, that video?
    Ms. Bickert. I am sorry, which video?
    Mr. Soto. Would the fake Pelosi video be labeled as false 
under your new policy?
    Ms. Bickert. Yes. And it was labeled false. At the time we 
did--we think we could have gotten that to fact checkers 
faster, and we think the label that we put on it could have 
been more clear. We now have the label for something that has 
been rated false. You have to click through it so it actually 
obscures the image. And it says ``false information.'' And it 
says ``This has been rated false by fact checkers.'' You have 
to click through it, and you see information from the fact-
checking source.
	  Mr. Soto. Thanks.
    In 2016 there was a fake Trump rally put together by 
Russians in Florida, complete with a Hillary Clinton in a 
prison and a fake Bill Clinton.
    Could a fake rally be created today through Facebook in the 
United States by the Russians under existing technology?
    Ms. Bickert. The network that created that was fake and 
inauthentic, and we removed it. We were slow to find it.
    I think our enforcement has gotten a lot better. And, as a 
data point for that, in 2016 we removed one such network. This 
past year, we removed more than 50 networks. Now, that is a 
global number all over the world. But these are organizations 
that are using networks of accounts--some fake, some real--in 
an attempt to obscure who they are or to push false 
information.
	 Ms. Bickert. I am sorry. Could you repeat that?
    Mr. Soto. What you do think Facebook and other social 
platforms' duty is to prevent the spread of lies across the 
internet?
    Ms. Bickert. I can speak for Facebook. We think it is 
important for people to be able to connect safely and with 
authentic information. And my team is responsible for both.
    So there is our approach to misinformation where we try to 
get people--label contented as false and get them accurate 
information. And then there is everything we also do to remove 
abusive content that violates our standards.
    Mr. Soto. Thank you, Ms. Bickert.
    Dr. Donovan, I saw you reacting to the fake Trump rally 
aspect. Could that still happen now under existing safeguards 
in social media?


 Ms. Donovan, do you see value in promoting impartial, 
decentralized methods of identity verification as a tool to 
combat the spread of misinformation?
    Dr. Donovan. I think in limited cases, yes, especially 
around purchasing of advertising, which is allowing you to 
break out of your known networks and to reach other people, 
especially if those advertising features do allow you to target 
very specific groups.
    I am interested in learning more about this consensus on 
definition, because I also think it might help us understand 
what is a social media company, what are their--how do we 
define their broadcast mechanisms, how do we define them 
related to the media, media company, as well as the other kinds 
of products that they build. And I think it would also get us a 
lot further in understanding what it is we say when we say 
deepfakes or even AI.
    Ms. Matsui. OK. The European Commission has recently 
announced that it will be supporting research to advance 
blockchain technology to support a more accurate online news 
environment.


 Ms. Matsui. Thank you.
    It is an undisputed fact, reaffirmed by America's 
intelligence agencies, that Russia interfered in our 2016 and 
2018 elections through targeted and prolonged online campaigns. 
We know that Russia is ramping up for 2020, and the American 
voters will once again be exposed to new lies, falsehoods, and 
misinformation designed to sow division in our democratic 
process.
    While I was glad to see the recent funding bill included 
$425 million in election security grants, this is only part of 
a much larger solution. To protect the most fundamental 
function of our democracy, social media companies need to take 
clear, forceful action against foreign attempts to interfere 
with our elections.
    Mr. Harris, how have the various election interference 
strategies evolved from the 2016 and 2018 election cycles?
    Mr. Harris. You know, I am actually not an expert on 
exactly what Russia is doing now. What I will say is I think 
that we need a mass public awareness campaign to inoculate the 
public. Think of it as like a cultural vaccine.
    And there is actually precedent in the United States for 
this. So, back in the 1940s, we had the Committee for National 
Morale and the Institute for Propaganda Analysis that actually 
did a domestic awareness campaign about the threat of fascist 
propaganda.
	You have probably seen the videos from--they are black and 
white--from 1947. It was called ``Don't Be a Sucker.'' And they 
had us looking at a guy spouting fascist propaganda, someone 
starting to nod, and then the guy taps him on the shoulder and 
says, ``Now, son, that is fascist propaganda, and here is how 
to spot it.''


 Back in June, I sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg, and I was 
joined by nearly all the Democrats on the committee. In this 
letter we noted that we are concerned about the potential 
conflict of interest between Facebook's bottom line and 
addressing misinformation on its platform. Six months later, I 
remain very concerned that Facebook is putting its bottom line 
ahead of addressing misinformation.
    Ms. Bickert, Facebook's content monetization policy states 
that content that depicts or discusses subjects in the 
following categories may face reduced or restricted 
monetization, and misinformation is included on the list. It is 
troubling that your policy doesn't simply ban misinformation.
    Do you think there are cases where misinformation can and 
should be monetized? Please answer yes or no.
    Ms. Bickert. Congressman, no. If we see somebody that is 
intentionally sharing misinformation, and we make this clear in 
our policies, they will lose the ability to monetize.
    Mr. McNerney. OK. Well, that sounds different than what is 
in your company's stated policy.
    But the response I received from Facebook to my letter 
failed to answer many of my questions. For example, I asked the 
following question that was left unanswered, and I would like 
to give you a chance to answer it today. How many project 
managers does Facebook employ whose full-time job it is to 
address misinformation?
    Ms. Bickert. Congressman, I don't have a number of PMs. I 
can tell you that across my team, our engineering teams, and 
our content review teams, this is something that is a priority. 
Building that network of the relationships with more than 50 
fact-checking organizations is something that has taken the 
efforts of a number of teams across the company.
    Mr. McNerney. Does that include software engineers?
    Ms. Bickert. It does, because there for any of these 
programs you need to have an infrastructure that can help 
recognize when something might be misinformation, allow people 
to report when something might be misinformation, get things 
over to the fact-checking organization.
    Mr. McNerney. OK. So I am going to ask you to provide that 
information, how many full-time employees, including software 
engineers who were employed in that, to identify 
misinformation.


  Mr. McNerney. You think that would be fast enough to keep 
deepfakes from going viral or other misinformation from going 
viral?
    Ms. Bickert. If they rate something proactively then it 
happens instantly. And we also use technology and use the 
reporting to flag content to them, and we often see that they 
will rate it very quickly.
    Mr. McNerney. Well, moving on, I am very concerned that 
Facebook is not prepared to address misinformation on its 
platform in advance of this year's election. Will you commit to 
having a third-party audit conducted by June 1 of Facebook's 
practices for combating the spread of disinformation on its 
platform and for the results of this audit to be made available 
to the public?
    Ms. Bickert. Congressman, we are very happy to answer any 
questions about how we do what we do. We think transparency is 
important. And we are happy to follow up with any suggestions 
that you have.
    Mr. McNerney. I would request a third-party audit--I am not 
talking about the civil rights audit--an independent third-
party audit be conducted at Facebook by June 1.


 Ms. Clarke. Thank you very much, Madam Chair.
    And I thank our ranking member, I thank our panelists for 
their expert witness here today.
    Deepfakes currently pose a significant and an unprecedented 
threat. Now more than ever, we need to prepare for the 
possibility that foreign adversaries will use deepfakes to 
spread disinformation and interfere in our election, which is 
why I have successfully secured language in the NDAA requiring 
notification be given to Congress if Russia or China seek to do 
exactly this.
    But deepfakes have been and will be used to harm individual 
Americans. We have already seen instances of women's images 
being superimposed on fake pornographic videos. As these tools 
become more affordable and accessible, we can expect deepfakes 
to be used to influence financial markets, discredit 
dissidents, and even incite violence.
    That is why I have introduced the first House bill to 
address this threat, the DEEPFAKES Accountability Act, which 
requires creators to label deepfakes as altered content, 
updates our identity theft statutes for digital impersonation, 
and requires cooperation between the government and private 
sector to develop detection technologies. I am now working on a 
second bill specifically to address how online platforms deal 
with deepfake content.
    So, Dr. Donovan, cheap fakes. We have often talked about 
deepfakes, where the technology footprint of the content has 
changed. But can you talk a bit more about the national 
security implications of cheap fakes, such as the Pelosi video, 
where footage is simply altered instead of entirely fabricated?
    Dr. Donovan. One of the most effective political uses of a 
cheap fake is to draw attention and shift the entire media 
narrative towards a false claim. And so particularly what we 
saw last week with the Biden video was concerning because you 
have hundreds of newsrooms kick into gear to dispute something, 
a video, and platforms have allowed it to scale to a level 
where the public is curious and are looking for that content, 
and then are also coming into contact with other nefarious 
actors and networks.


Ms. Bickert, Facebook is a founding member of the Deepfake 
Technology Challenge, but detection is only partially a 
technology issue. We also need to have a definition of what 
fake is and a policy for which kind of fake videos are actually 
acceptable.
    Last summer you informed Congress that Facebook is working 
on a precise definition for what constitutes a deepfake. Can 
you update us on those efforts, especially in light of your 
announcement yesterday? And specifically how do you intend to 
differentiate between legitimate deepfakes, such as those 
created by Hollywood for entertainment, and malicious ones?
    Ms. Bickert. Thank you for the question.
    The policy that we put out yesterday is designed to address 
the most sophisticated types of manipulated media, and this 
fits within the definition of what many academics would call 
deepfakes, so that we can remove it.
	 Now, beyond that, we do think it is useful to work with 
others in industry and civil society and academia to actually 
have common definitions so we are all talking about the same 
thing. And those are conversations that we have been a part of 
in the past 6 months. We will continue to be a part of those. 
And we are hoping that, working together with industry and 
other stakeholders, we will be able to come up with 
comprehensive definitions.
    Ms. Clarke. Should the intent of the deepfake or rather its 
subject matter be the focus?
    Ms. Bickert. I am sorry. Could you repeat that?
    Ms. Clarke. Should the intent of the deepfake or the 
subject matter be the focus?
    Ms. Bickert. From our standpoint, it is often difficult to 
tell intent when we are talking about many different types of 
abuse, but also specifically with deepfakes for misinformation, 
and that is why if you look at our policy definition it doesn't 
focus on intent so much as what the effects would be on the 
viewer.",Congressional Hearing on Online Deception and Platform Responsibility,"This excerpt includes opening statements from Hon. Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Hon. Greg Walden, representatives in Congress, during a hearing focused on online deception and platform responsibility. Rodgers emphasizes the need to combat disinformation and highlights the historical parallels with yellow journalism, stressing the importance of rebuilding trust in online sources. She welcomes recent efforts by platforms like Facebook to combat deepfakes. In contrast, Walden discusses the challenges posed by the internet's openness to manipulation by bad actors, emphasizing past legislative efforts to address platform responsibility and online harms. Both representatives acknowledge the complexity of the digital ecosystem and the urgent need for regulatory measures and technological innovations to protect consumers."

 Russia is not our friend. Vladimir Putin is not a partner 
of the United States. He is a dictator who just last week 
extended his tenure to 2036. He has robbed his people of their 
rights. He has trampled on the sovereignty of his neighbors. He 
has used the resources of the Russian government to undermine 
democracy, splinter NATO and the EU, and bolster other despots 
like Assad. His tools are disinformation, violent suppression, 
and assassination. All of that is contemptible enough, but 
putting a price on American heads is a serious escalation.


 Mr. McCaul. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I hope everybody can 
hear me okay. Thank you for calling this important hearing.
    As I have said time and time again--and I agree with the 
chairman that Vladimir Putin is not our friend, not a friend to 
the United States or our allies. In the past few years, we have 
witnessed his regime invade and occupy parts of Ukraine and 
Georgia, unleash devastating cyber attacks against our allies, 
use a banned nerve agent to try to kill a former Russian spy in 
the UK, prop up corrupt regimes in Syria and Venezuela. They 
meddled in our elections. They undermine American interests 
around the world. He has proven he just cannot be trusted and 
he certainly is not our friend.


  Over the last decade and a half, Moscow has applied the 
full suite of Russian power to dominate its neighbors, create 
division in the West, and position Russia as a global power. 
The suite of tools has included military and paramilitary 
forces, economic and energy embargoes, assassination and 
political subterfuge, information and cyber warfare, separatist 
groups, and frozen conflicts. That campaign history includes a 
2007 cyber attack on Estonia, the 2008 invasion of Georgia, the 
2014 invasion of Ukraine, the 2016 coup attempt in Montenegro, 
assassinations in the United Kingdom, Germany, just last week 
in Austria, and elsewhere.


Third, we need to more effectively counter Russia's 
dissemination of false information. In this realm, the United 
States essentially disarmed itself when it closed the doors in 
1999 of the United States Information Agency. This multibillion 
agency was our frontline force on the information front. 
Congress should reestablish or establish a modernized version 
of USIA, so that the United States can return to the offense in 
this dynamic and fast-paced dimension of international affairs.


 And I have no doubt that some of that was used in the 
northern part of Afghanistan against Afghan units with American 
advisors, especially in the Kunduz area. And so, I think that, 
in this sense, now specifically offering bounties is a small 
step from what they were already doing. Their justification for 
this action was the fight against ISIS, but part of this was, 
as the other witnesses have mentioned, a false narrative and 
misinformation on the part of Russia that the United States was 
supporting ISIS.


 Mr. Brzezinski, I will stick with you, if I can. It seems 
like we have been playing defense vis-a-vis the Russians, and 
the Chinese, for that matter, relative to disinformation and 
propaganda for way too long, for some time. What would you 
suggest in terms of a more proactive U.S. policy in this area? 
And, of course, we are not interested in propaganda. We are 
interested in getting the truth out there. But how can the U.S. 
do a better job vis-a-vis both Russia and the Chinese in that 
sphere?
    Mr. Brzezinski. Information operations have been long a 
part of U.S. policy. It was our effective management of 
information operations and engagement, so to speak, public 
diplomacy, in the cold war that was probably one of the keys to 
our success . We won economically, we won militarily, but we 
also won in the information engagement sphere, the public 
diplomacy sphere.


 Mr. Perry. I mean, I understand for the purposes of the 
hearing, but you understand there is a bigger story here, and 
just making the presumption or assumption that they are true 
(a) not having seen any of the intelligence personally, and (b) 
understanding that the GRU is, as I am sure you all know, is 
daily engaged in misinformation; and finally, as you probably 
know, this is based on very specious reports of human 
intelligence by individuals that have a motive to provide 
misinformation to the United States. I just think that that is 
breathtakingly irresponsible.


 I agree with Dr. Wallander. There was a lot of hedging 
activity, we would call it, I would say, as it was unclear what 
the United States' intentions were near the end of the Obama 
Administration. And we had a Stated intention to leave. We did 
see Pakistanis, Iranians, as well as Russians, all getting 
involved, I think to gain some influence in what was going to 
be the environment after we left, after the U.S. and NATO left.
    So, I think a part of it was motivated by a desire to gain 
leverage, and then, another part is their legitimate concern 
about the spillover of terrorism into Central Asia and Russia. 
However, this was overStated and this was called their 
misinformation campaign, suggesting that the United States was 
supporting ISIS, and, in fact, it was deliberately promoting 
it.


",Combating Russian Disinformation and Aggression,"The text highlights the aggressive actions of the Russian government under Vladimir Putin, including invasions, cyber attacks, and support for corrupt regimes. It emphasizes the need for the United States to recognize Russia as an adversary and implement strategies to counter its aggression, including reestablishing an information agency to combat disinformation effectively.

 In addition to these challenges, the countries are 
struggling to combat misinformation and a lack of public health 
education on preventative measures. True to their authoritarian 
nature, the regimes of Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua, are 
using the pandemic to maintain their stranglehold on power, 
manipulate their people, and further oppress their citizens.


 The United States needs a strategy for how it will respond, 
and not only to the immediate health impact of the pandemic but 
also to the secondary impacts of the crisis on the late 
elections in Bolivia, the growing influence of adversaries like 
Iran in Venezuela, the exploitation of the crisis by 
transnational criminal organizations--and, by the way, thank 
you, Chairman, for holding that hearing on
    [inaudible] Here a while back--and increased food 
insecurity, as well as the continual malign influence of China.


 We are also facing the challenge of malign external 
influence, particularly by the Chinese Communist Party, Iran, 
and others. Beijing has intervened in sovereign nations' 
internal affairs to engineer consent for its policies attaching 
strings to our neighbors everyday well-being.


But I would say, when you go around the region, sure, 
people will take a face mask from China if that is what is 
available, but that does not mean that they think China is 
helping on this. They all know the figures that China has put 
out on its own experience are completely ridiculous and false.


 Mr. Castro. Okay. Let me ask you all, during the 
coronavirus pandemic, we have seen several Latin America 
governments take on authoritarian physicians and spread false 
information to their own people. For example, El Salvador's 
government has detained their citizens for violating their 
stay-at-home order and forcing them to stay in quarantine 
centers.
    On the other hand, President Bolsonaro of Brazil continues 
to downplay the statistics and danger of the virus, putting 
Brazilians in danger. What actions has the State Department and 
USAID taken to discourage these displays of antidemocratic rule 
and the spread of misinformation?
    Mr. Kozak. Well, as I mentioned before, Mr. Castro, we have 
tried to be a little bit cautious about telling other countries 
how to deal with the pandemic. We have not found the magic 
formula yet for getting the right balance between, you know, 
stay-at-home orders and recovering the economy.


Mr. Kozak. Sir, I believe our criticisms with respect to 
both Venezuela and Nicaragua have been a systematic effort to 
cover up what is going on on the medical front, reporting false 
information, not only to their own populations, but to medical 
authorities and so on. That is distinct from the legal issues 
of whether one branch of government has a certain amount of 
authority over it or not. This is kind of unprecedented areas.",Addressing Authoritarian Exploitation and Misinformation Amidst the Pandemic in Latin America,"The text discusses the challenges faced by countries in Latin America, particularly Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua, in combating misinformation and authoritarian exploitation during the COVID-19 pandemic. These regimes are accused of using the crisis to maintain power, manipulate their citizens, and further oppress their people. Additionally, the United States is urged to develop a strategy to respond not only to the immediate health impact of the pandemic but also to its secondary impacts, including political instability, increased influence of adversaries like Iran, and the exploitation of the crisis by transnational criminal organizations. China's malign influence in the region is also highlighted. Discussions between government officials touch on efforts by authoritarian regimes to suppress information, detain citizens, and downplay the severity of the virus, and the role of the State Department and USAID in discouraging antidemocratic actions and the spread of misinformation."

                Government of the People's Republic of China to 
                leverage predatory economic practices as a means of 
                political and economic coercion in the Indo-Pacific 
                region and beyond;
                    (E) to promote the values of democracy and human 
                rights, including through efforts to end the repression 
                by the People's Republic of China of political 
                dissidents, Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, 
                Tibetan Buddhists, Christians, and other ethnic 
                minorities;
                    (F) to respond to the crackdown by the People's 
                Republic of China, in contravention of the commitments 
                made under the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 
                and the Basic Law of Hong Kong, on the legitimate 
                aspirations of the people of Hong Kong; and
                    (G) to counter the Chinese Government's efforts to 
                spread disinformation in China and beyond with respect 
                to its response to COVID-19.

 STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID R. STILWELL, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR 
   EAST ASIAN AND PACIFIC AFFAIRS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE, 
                         WASHINGTON, DC

    Mr. Stilwell. Thank you, Chairman Risch, Ranking Member 
Menendez, and members of the Foreign Relations Committee.
    We appreciate the opportunity to testify before this 
committee to discuss the threat posed by the Chinese Communist 
Party, that threat to the United States and the global order, 
and what we are doing about it.
    I am here to tell you--today with several Department 
colleagues. The fact that the three of us are testifying on CCP 
malign influence across three different geographic regions is a 
testament to the global challenge we face and how the 
Department is adjusting to meet this challenge.
    For years, we and the international community credited 
Beijing's commitments that facilitating China's entry into the 
rules-based international order would lead to increasing 
domestic reform and opening. Beijing's persistent flouting of 
these commitments has shattered those illusions. It is now 
clear to us, and to more and more countries around the world, 
that PRC foreign and security policy seeks to reshape the 
international environment around the narrow interests and 
authoritarian values of a single beneficiary; that is, the 
Chinese Communist Party.
    Beijing's malign conduct is increasingly being noticed: 
bullying behavior of foreign companies and governments, 
manipulation of international organizations, silencing critics 
abroad, buying, stealing, or forcing tech transfers, spreading 
disinformation, egregious human rights abuses, stabilizing--or 
destabilizing territorial revisionism. Beijing's cover-up of 
the outbreak of COVID-19 especially highlighted the global 
dangers of the CCP's lack of transparency and use of 
disinformation.


In the information space, the battle against CCP malign 
activities requires messaging that is well-informed, well-
crafted, and well-executed around the world. Our public 
diplomacy teams work with the Bureau of Global Public Affairs 
and the Global Engagement Center to promote a positive vision 
of U.S. leadership, expose PRC malign conduct, and counter 
propaganda and disinformation.


 For over 2 years, we have called on countries to secure 
their 5G networks from untrusted vendors, and more and more 
countries and companies are doing--and companies are doing just 
that. Last month, Secretary Pompeo announced the Clean Networks 
Initiative, focused on safeguarding citizens' privacy and 
companies' most sensitive information from manipulation or 
disruption by foreign adversaries, including via apps in app 
stores, cloud service providers, and undersea cables. We are 
also bringing transparency and reciprocity to Beijing's vectors 
of malign influence, including propaganda outlets, Confucius 
Institutes, United Front organizations, state-owned 
enterprises, and more. Since February, we have designated as 
foreign missions the U.S.-based operations of nine propaganda 
outlets and the Confucius Institutes U.S. Center. In March, we 
capped the number of PRC nationals allowed to work at these 
designated state media outlets. In July, we closed the PRC 
consulate in Houston due to serious concerns about the 
inappropriate activities of its diplomats. We now require 
senior PRC diplomats to seek permission before many meetings, 
large events, and visits to academic institutions, as Beijing 
has long done to our diplomats in China.
    In support of these efforts, we sincerely appreciate 
congressional leadership in establishing the new Counter China 
Influence Fund in Fiscal Year 2020 appropriations bill. This 
very important provision provides the Department with a 
flexible mechanism that will bolster our efforts to strengthen 
our partners' resiliency to Chinese malign influence worldwide. 
The initial round of CCIF funding solicitation resulted in over 
400 project submissions from around the globe, with demand far 
outstripping the appropriated funding.


 Similar concepts have been put forward by Japan, India, 
Australia, Taiwan, and South Korea, as well as by ASEAN in the 
ASEAN Outlook for the Indo-Pacific, showing remarkable 
alignment across our partners. We advanced our economic 
initiatives in lockstep with our allies and partners in areas 
like high-standard infrastructure, energy security, investment 
screening, and many more. We are strengthening commercial 
diplomacy to boost alternatives to PRC predatory economics that 
leaves countries saddled with unsustainable debt and vulnerable 
to political and economic pressure.
    To promote good governance, we launched the Indo-Pacific 
Transparency Initiative, 2 years ago, which has programs 
focused on particular vectors of PRC influence, including 
corruption, disinformation, and information control, and 
coercive financing.


 In all of our efforts, outreach to other countries is 
critical, and we are seeing results. Dozens of countries have 
now taken action to restrict untrusted Beijing-linked vendors 
from their 5G networks. We have also seen stricter investment 
screening mechanisms in the EU and more than a dozen other 
countries. Some 54 countries came together to deny the PRC 
candidate to the top leadership position in the World 
Intellectual Property Organization. Twenty-three countries 
joined us in cosigning a joint event on Xinjiang at the U.N. 
Third Committee. More and more countries are taking action 
against Confucius Institutes, United Front organizations, and 
propaganda outlets. We have released several joint statements 
on Hong Kong with allies and partners, many of whom have 
suspended extradition treaties with Hong Kong and imposed 
export controls. We are encouraging all countries to push for 
transparency and reciprocity in the relations with the PRC, and 
to expose and counter CCP vectors of influence and 
interference, including by PRC state media personnel, 
diplomats, PLA researchers, and state enterprise and employees, 
and others.
    In conclusion, the United States continues to have an 
important relationship with the PRC, as do most countries in 
the world. We are not asking countries to choose between the 
United States and China, but to hold Beijing accountable for 
its malign behavior and, in the process, to protect their own 
national sovereignty, security, and long-term economic well-
being. We are asking the international community to join us in 
standing up for universal rights and the rules-based 
international system, and have provided for the world's 
collective peace, security, and prosperity for generations. We 
are making great strides toward this goal, and we deeply 
appreciate this committee's support to our continued efforts.


 Prepared Statement of David R. Stilwell

    Chairman Risch, Ranking Member Menendez, and Members of the 
Committee: Thank you for the opportunity to testify before the 
Committee to discuss the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party 
(CCP) to the United States and the global order, and what we are doing 
about it. I am joined by my Department colleagues, PDAS Julie Chung 
from our Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, and A/S Philip Reeker 
from our Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs. The fact that the 
three of us are testifying on CCP malign influence, representing three 
different geographic regions, is a testament to the global challenge we 
face and how the Department is adjusting to meet this challenge.
    As Secretary Pompeo has repeatedly said, China is the first foreign 
policy challenge he thinks about each morning. Every one of us at the 
Department of State is focused on succeeding in this critical effort. I 
will center my testimony on an overview of our China policy, the CCP's 
actions globally and how State is responding, and then focus 
specifically on what we are doing in the East Asia and Pacific region.


increasing ccp aggression
    A few months ago, as the world was coming to grips with the reality 
of the global pandemic, one of China's leading virologists warned that 
the coronavirus was ``just the tip of the iceberg.'' She was speaking 
as an epidemiologist and urging a global response to prevent future 
outbreaks, but that analogy is a useful way to think about CCP 
aggression and malign activities globally.
    For each visible example of CCP malign activity worldwide, there 
are many more lurking beneath the surface. Part of our job in the 
Department, and especially in the EAP Bureau, is to help bring more of 
that iceberg into the open for other nations to see the CCP for what it 
truly is--an aggressive, autocratic, ambitious, paranoid, hostile 
threat to free and open societies and the free and open international 
order.
    Beijing's aggressive behavior takes many forms, including assaults 
on foreign companies and governments; manipulation of international 
organizations; silencing of critics abroad; buying, stealing, or 
forcing the transfer of technology to further its military and economic 
ambitions; and spreading disinformation. Beijing's cover-up of the 
outbreak of COVID-19 has made urgently clear to the international 
community the dangers of the CCP's lack of transparency and use of 
disinformation to global health and security. This is not an 
aberration; this is a reflection of how the CCP operates.


 how our policy has changed
    At the Department of State, we are working hard every day to 
counter the CCP's malign activities around the world. In implementing 
the President's 2017 National Security Strategy, we are pushing back on 
revisionist powers, such as the PRC, who use technology, propaganda, 
and coercion to shape a world antithetical to our interests and values. 
We are holding the CCP to its commitments, both to us and to global 
rules, norms, and organizations. We will call them out publicly when 
they fall short. And we will vigorously defend our interests and those 
of our friends and allies when they are threatened. Not since the Cold 
War have we focused our efforts so intently on a single foreign policy 
challenge, and I can assure you we are firing on all cylinders across 
the full spectrum of the China challenge.


 general state department china policy areas
Public Diplomacy and Counter Propaganda and Disinformation
    The battle against CCP malign activities requires messaging that is 
well-informed, well-crafted, and well-executed all around the world. 
Accordingly, our public diplomacy teams are working in partnership with 
the Bureau of Global Public Affairs and the Global Engagement Center 
(GEC) to promote a positive vision of U.S. leadership, expose malign 
conduct, and counter propaganda and disinformation.
    From the Secretary on down, all of our leaders and public diplomacy 
practitioners are empowered to convey these messages. Our Ambassadors 
in the field across all geographic regions have been particularly 
effective in taking this challenge on. The Bureau of Global Public 
Affairs (GPA) supports our team in the field by regularly disseminating 
topline messages and senior leader statements. GPA also publishes 
original content that describes American values and contrasts CCP 
behavior with global norms.
    The GEC has significantly expanded its work on the China challenge 
over the last year. GEC works in partnership across the Department, our 
posts overseas, the NSC, and relevant departments and agencies to 
coordinate strategies and tactics. GEC's efforts to counter CCP 
propaganda include increasing awareness of the problematic aspects of 
the One Belt One Road initiative, human rights abuses in Xinjiang, 
Tibet, and elsewhere in China, and Beijing's abuse of open research and 
academic environments to achieve its military objectives. GEC programs 
build global resilience to PRC disinformation through media training 
and other support to investigative journalists and to map PRC influence 
in the information environment to guide current and future approaches.
	 The GEC also supports efforts to provide accurate information about 
U.S. policies and contributions of U.S. businesses to local communities 
to restrict the space where CCP propaganda can take root. Across the 
Department, we leverage GEC's analytical tools and networks of credible 
partners and local voices overseas.


Combatting Malign Influence
    Malign CCP influence manifests itself through a diversity of 
organizations, from PRC diplomatic missions to propaganda outlets, 
Confucius Institutes, United Front organizations, state-owned 
enterprises and more.
    On the media front, since February we have designated the U.S.-
based operations of nine PRC propaganda outlets--including Xinhua, 
People's Daily, and China Global Television Network--as foreign 
missions. In March, we capped the number of PRC nationals allowed to 
work at these designated state media outlets to more closely match the 
number of independent American journalists Beijing allows to operate in 
the PRC.
    We have likewise designated the Confucius Institutes U.S. Center 
(CIUS) as a foreign mission. While claiming no other aim than to teach 
Americans about Chinese language and culture, the Confucius Institutes 
also promote the Chinese Communist Party's agenda and subvert academic 
freedom.
    We must recognize these entities for what they are--organizations 
under Beijing's control and vectors for CCP propaganda and influence. 
Americans should know that they are not independent media or simple 
educational institutions. We are also encouraging social media 
companies to label PRC official media accounts clearly so that everyone 
recognizes them as propaganda tools of the CCP. In July, we closed the 
PRC Consulate in Houston due to serious concerns about the 
inappropriate activities of its diplomats. We now require senior PRC 
diplomats to seek permission for many meetings, large events, and 
visits to academic institutions. Of course, the longstanding barriers 
that Beijing imposes on U.S. diplomats in China remain far more severe.
	 We appreciate Congressional leadership in establishing the new 
Counter Chinese Influence Fund (CCIF) in the FY 2020 appropriations 
bill. This very important provision provides the U.S. interagency with 
a flexible mechanism that will bolster our efforts to strengthen our 
partners' resiliency to China's malign influence worldwide.


 We have advanced our economic initiatives in lockstep with our 
allies and partners. I have already mentioned the Blue Dot Network--
launched with Australia and Japan--as one example. In the Indo-Pacific 
region, we are working together on the ground, for example through a 
five-country partnership with Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, to 
bring electricity to the people of Papua New Guinea.
    To promote good governance, which is integral to U.S. foreign 
policy and national security interests and in line with U.S. values, we 
launched the Indo-Pacific Transparency Initiative 2 years ago. With it, 
we are optimizing longstanding programs and launching new ones focused 
on particular vectors of PRC influence, including corruption, 
disinformation and information control, and coercive financing. These 
programs promote civil society, rule of law, respect for human rights 
and fundamental freedoms, and transparent and accountable governments 
across the region.


global outreach successes
    In all of our policy efforts, outreach to other countries is 
critical. We have been vigorously engaging our allies and partners on 
the full scope of CCP malign activities, including 5G, military-civil 
fusion, human rights abuses, environmental degradation, propaganda and 
disinformation, and international organizations, among many other 
issues.
    In the technology realm, dozens of countries have now taken action 
to restrict untrusted Beijing-linked vendors from their 5G networks. 
We've also seen stricter investment screening mechanisms instituted in 
the EU and more than a dozen other countries to help protect critical 
technology or infrastructure, including from CCP control. On 
international organizations, some 54 countries came together to deny 
the PRC candidate the top leadership position of the World Intellectual 
Property Organization. Twenty-three countries joined us in co-signing a 
joint statement on Xinjiang at the U.N. Third Committee. Allies and 
partners have also joined together to oppose Beijing's efforts to 
insert language promoting CCP ideology and unilateral policy 
initiatives in United Nations documents.
    Regarding CCP influence and interference, more and more countries 
are taking action against Confucius Institutes, United Front 
organizations, and other vectors of CCP malign influence and 
disinformation, including CCP influence efforts on university campuses. 
On Hong Kong, we have released several joint statements with allies and 
partners, many of which have also suspended extradition treaties with 
Hong Kong and imposed export controls. In line with what we have done 
in these areas, we encourage all countries to push for transparency and 
reciprocity in their relations with the PRC, and to expose and counter 
CCP vectors of influence and interference, including by PRC state media 
and PRC diplomats.


We must think of Europe not just in terms of what we can do 
together elsewhere in the world, but as a theater of strategic 
competition in its own right. Allies face malign influence and 
pressure in their own countries that we must work with them to 
counter. Using platforms like the One Belt, One Road 
Initiative, the Chinese Communist Party endeavors to create 
dependencies and cultivate client-state relationships. Through 
the 17+1 Initiative, which involves 12 countries that are both 
NATO and EU members, primarily in Central and Eastern Europe, 
China aims to achieve access and ownership over valuable 
transportation hubs, critical infrastructure, ports, and 
industries.


 As we confront the growing China challenge in Europe, we 
must not forget that Europe is also the central focus of 
ongoing Russian aggression and malign influence. Although 
China's GDP is about eight times the size of Russia's, Russia 
remains the primary military threat to Europe and the strategic 
priority for most of our allies and partners, particularly 
those in Central and Eastern Europe.
    Russia and China are more closely aligned strategically 
than at any point since the 1950s, and we see growing 
cooperation across a range of diplomatic, military, economic, 
and information activities. Russia and China are not a 
monolithic bloc, and there are certainly tensions and friction 
points in that relationship. But, their growing strategic 
convergence is more than a simple marriage of convenience. It 
is based on a shared assessment of the threat the United States 
and our allies pose to their ambitions through our strength, 
our prosperity, and our values. This dynamic is not going away 
anytime soon, and we must understand and account for it in our 
diplomacy and policies in this era of great-power competition 
in Europe.


 Nor can we focus our efforts on the relative simplicity of a one-
on-one competition like we did in the Cold War. In addition to 
confronting the growing challenges from the Chinese Communist Party, we 
must not forget that Europe is also the central focus of ongoing 
Russian aggression and malign influence. Although China's GDP is about 
eight times the size of Russia's. Russia remains the primary military 
threat to Europe and a strategic priority for most of our Allies and 
partners, particularly those in Central and Eastern Europe. Russia and 
China are more closely aligned strategically than at any point since 
the 1950s, and we see growing cooperation across a range of diplomatic, 
military, economic, and information activities.


While the growing Russia-PRC convergence presents challenges, it 
also presents opportunities to maximize the impact and cost-
effectiveness of our policies and assistance programs in Europe. To 
give one example: the Chinese Communist Party and the Kremlin exploit 
similar vulnerabilities--weak or corrupt institutions, elite capture, 
non-transparent or unaccountable governance structures, etc. Therefore, 
focusing our efforts on addressing problems like this--which we are 
doing through our assistance programs, including the Countering Russian 
Influence Fund and USAID's Countering Malign Kremlin Influence 
Development Framework--enables us to counter two threats for the price 
of one.


 Finally, our public diplomacy, especially our people-to-
people diplomacy, advances the fourth pillar of our strategy, a 
hemisphere that embraces democracy and views the U.S. as a 
valued partner in the region. We are forging relationships that 
will reduce the space for China to spread its malign influence 
and reinforce why our shared values are so important. Our 
exchange programs, public-private partnerships, and grants help 
showcase the innovation of the United States, the vitality of 
our entrepreneurship, and the power of the individual to make a 
difference in their community, strengthening our relationships 
with civil society, businesses, and especially the youth. This 
is the time to strengthen academic and professional exchanges, 
more than ever, so we remain well-positioned for generations to 
come.


 public diplomacy
    Our public diplomacy advances the fourth pillar of our regional 
strategy--a Hemisphere that continues to embrace U.S. values and 
leadership--by forging relationships that reduce the space for China to 
spread its malign activities. We have several successful programs that 
are building these bonds for future generations. The Young Leaders of 
the Americas Initiative (YLAI) expands ties between emerging 
entrepreneurs and U.S. counterparts to support job creation and 
economic growth. The Department's Academy for Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) 
provides women the knowledge, tools, and networks they need to turn 
their ideas into successful businesses. And the very successful 100,000 
Strong in the Americas (100K) Innovation Fund, a public-private 
partnership, supports educational exchanges that strengthen the links 
between education, workforce development, and social inclusion to 
address opportunity gaps.
    Our exchange programs, extensive network of American Spaces and 
American Space partnerships, and robust offering of post-identified and 
managed small grants all help foster and deepen U.S. relationships with 
influencers and target audiences. The Global Engagement Center (GEC) 
supports our efforts to address propaganda and disinformation in the 
Hemisphere by providing original research and working with U.S. public 
diplomacy officers in the field. The PRC has recognized its cultural 
capital deficit in the region and attempted to duplicate our playbook, 
making huge investments to expand its network of Confucius Centers. 
These networks allow the PRC to increase its cultural influence in the 
Hemisphere and to send thousands of young people to China on academic 
and professional exchanges. But we will not cede to the PRC the next 
generation of leadership in our Hemisphere. From my meetings with young 
hackathoners in Haiti to women entrepreneurs in the Bahamas to student 
activists in Nicaragua, this is the generation who turns to the United 
States for our innovation, opportunity, and values. This is the time to 
strengthen our public diplomacy strategy so we remain well positioned 
for generations to come. We must remain engaged in the Western 
Hemisphere, and our diplomats in the field and those who support them 
in Washington both need and appreciate your continued support.



 As you know, the High Representative/Vice President of the 
European Union, Mr. Borrell, proposed this dialogue. It was 
shortly after the Secretary had joined the Foreign Affairs 
Committee of the EU during the summer, and we have spent the 
last couple of months working out the parameters of this 
through our Mission in Brussels, through the EU Mission here in 
Washington, and in direct contacts. We developed a set of 
pillars that we plan to focus on: recovery, of course, from the 
pandemic; focusing on reciprocity steps; and then resilience--
how do we deal with supply chains and other things? 
Disinformation is a major topic that everyone has said we need 
to discuss. And, of course, human rights. The Europeans have 
also suggested we include a discussion on international 
organizations and Chinese efforts to dominate those, and then 
just share our experiences in dealing with China. So, the idea 
is to have a forum where we can really review all aspects of 
the Chinese presence in Europe, globally, and how we deal with 
that.


 Now, the Administration and Congress must be united on 
implementing a long-term strategy that will benefit the 
American national security interests, promote American 
businesses, and create jobs through trade opportunities, and 
project American values of respect for the human rights and 
freedom for--respect for human rights and freedom across the 
globe. This includes countering China's malign influence, from 
the Indo-Pacific to Europe to the Western Hemisphere. In 
addition to maintaining a strong military that deters Chinese 
coercion and expansionism, the U.S. must pursue a strategy that 
secures U.S. technological primacy and economic security in the 
coming decades.


 In terms of USAID and State, we are in lockstep on our 
China strategy through the America Crece, which is an 
interagency effort, but also through USAID's Clear Choice 
framework that looks at governance, that makes sure that a 
procurement and civil society are all involved in the 
transparency efforts, and to bring those issues to light when 
we hear about opaque deals from China or any other country. So, 
we are very--we are working very closely. We are looking at 
USAID's programs and State programs to make sure we are closely 
aligned. And the programs I would do on anticorruption and 
civil society strengthening all go to build that space so that 
China's malign influence do not come and take over that space. 
So, we are very much closely aligned with USAID.


 Question. How is the U.S. engaging our allies and partners to 
dissuade them from integrating technologies and techniques predicated 
on digital authoritarianism?

    Answer. Guided by the 2018 National Cyber Strategy and the National 
Strategy to Secure 5G, the United States leads the international 
community in bilateral and multi-lateral fora to oppose digital 
authoritarianism. The Department's programs and policy efforts seek to 
universalize the framework for responsible state behavior in cyberspace 
we have promulgated in the U.N. and elsewhere; defend human rights 
online, including affirming people have the same rights online as they 
do offline; encourage allies and partners to restrict use of untrusted 
5G and other critical ICT networks vendors; promote multi-stakeholder 
internet governance models; build cyber capacity; combat disinformation 
online; and counteract use of the Internet for terrorist purposes.


 Question. Has the U.S. urged Europe to change its views on the 
Confucius Institutes and do you sense that European attitudes are 
shifting on these Chinese cultural and educational efforts?

    Answer. We have shared our experiences countering the Chinese 
Communist Party's malign influence with European partners, including 
issues related to research integrity, academic freedom, free speech on 
campuses, and Confucius Institutes. Recent decisions in Europe to 
shutter Confucius Institutes and increased scrutiny by European 
legislators and journalists of PRC influence on university campuses 
show that our engagement with likeminded partners is making a 
difference and attitudes are indeed changing. European governments and 
civil society are increasingly aware and active.


 Question. Does China play a role--either direct or indirect--in 
violations of human rights in Latin America and the Caribbean? If so, 
please cite specific examples.

    Answer. The People's Republic of China's (PRC) aggressive efforts 
to expand market share for state-affiliated firms, carry out 
infrastructure projects, implement disinformation campaigns, and export 
surveillance and censorship tools play a direct and indirect role in 
human rights violations in Latin America. The lack of transparency in 
transactions with the PRC and PRC-based entities, as well as an 
increase of the region's dependence on debt financing from the PRC, 
empowers corruption. The PRC's infrastructure projects often ignore 
both labor and environmental laws, undermining individual workers' 
rights and labor standards more generally. The PRC's control over local 
media outlets through bribes and other means silences investigative 
journalists who draw attention to human rights abuses and suppresses 
negative stories of the PRC's activities in the region. The PRC's 
export of surveillance and control equipment to the region also 
increases the risk to human rights defenders and those willing to 
expose human rights violators.


 Responses of Ambassador Philip T. Reeker to Questions 
                    Submitted by Senator Ben Cardin

    Question. To what do you attribute the recent shift in attitude of 
European nations away from a China policy organized around economic 
engagement toward one of limiting China's influence in Europe?

    Answer. Since the publication of the National Security Strategy in 
2017, the United States vigorously engaged with our European Allies and 
partners to alert them to threats posed by the People's Republic of 
China (PRC). Accelerated investment and acquisition of European 
companies by PRC companies has led Europeans to understand their 
economies are targets of Beijing's Made in China 2025 strategy, 
resulting in Europeans beginning to develop national and EU-wide 
investment screening mechanisms. The ``Transatlantic awakening'' on the 
PRC has deepened over the last year. Revelations of human rights abuse 
in Xinjiang, Beijing's targeting of Hong Kong with national security 
laws, and increasing PRC hostility toward Taiwan and others in the 
South China Sea have led Europeans to recognize the implications of 
enabling the malign activities of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). 
With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic Europeans suffered tragic 
consequences of Beijing's disinformation campaigns and lack of 
transparency. Continued U.S. engagement with European counterparts to 
highlight the nature and the pattern of CCP aggression has further 
shifted attitudes in Europe and contributed to the development of 
strategies and mechanisms to make Europe more resilient and better able 
to counter PRC malign influence.

    Question. How has Beijing responded to efforts by European leaders 
to reduce interdependence and balance relations?

    Answer. I believe Beijing has been surprised by the speed and 
degree to which many European leaders have reacted negatively to PRC 
bullying and disinformation efforts. In 2019 the European Commission 
issued its ``Strategic Outlook'' on EU-China relations that 
characterized the PRC as a partner, a competitor, and a systemic rival. 
The PRC is facing headwinds on a variety of issues in Europe, including 
investment screening, 5G, domestic interference, and multilateral 
engagement. The CCP is also facing increasing European public and 
parliamentary criticism on human rights, Hong Kong, aggression in the 
South China Sea, interference on university campuses, and many other 
issues. European public polls show increasingly unfavorable views of 
the PRC generally, and European politicians are increasingly forthright 
in calling out and countering PRC malign influence. The frosty 
receptions to the recent fence-mending trips to Europe by Foreign 
Minister Wang Yi and Politburo member Yang Jiechi reveal the degree to 
which European leaders are reducing dependence and rebalancing 
relations with the PRC.

 Question. How can the U.S. take advantage of the weakening 
relationship between China and CEE countries to counter China's 
influence in that region?

    Answer. We are developing partnerships with European governments 
and institutions to ensure that our relationships with the PRC are 
based on reciprocity, transparency, accountability, and respect for 
rule of law, property, labor rights, and human rights. Together with 
Europe, we need to ensure a constructive and results-oriented 
relationship with the PRC.
    In recent years, there has been a ``Transatlantic Awakening'' to 
the PRC Challenge, with increased European pushback. Examples include 
decisions by Sweden and Belgium to close Confucius Institutes; the 
Czech Senate President's visit to Taiwan despite threats of retaliation 
from the PRC; and an EU report exposing and condemning PRC 
disinformation tactics during the COVID pandemic. Both sides of the 
Atlantic see the need to curb PRC aggression, assert our sovereignty, 
and protect our economies.


 Question. How have European countries responded to the United 
States' strategic approach to China?

    Answer. We see a Transatlantic strategic alignment on the People's 
Republic of China (PRC) developing over a shared threat perception and 
common purpose to protect our democracies, open societies, and 
economies. In recent years, European governments have rolled out 
stronger investment screening regulations modelled on FIRRMA and CFIUS 
legislation and adopted an EU-wide investment screening mechanism. The 
EU identification of the PRC as an ``economic competitor'' and 
``systemic rival'' and the adoption of a toolbox of measures to secure 
5G networks are also important steps. Europeans have advocated for 
greater market reciprocity and a level playing field for European 
companies, understanding the threat that a state-controlled economy 
poses to free market values and intellectual property rights.
    Earlier this year European legislators launched a global 
initiative, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, that 
acknowledges the need for a whole-of-government approach. The U.S. 
National Security Strategy also recognizes the need to use all 
government tools in efforts to counter the PRC. At the 2019 Leaders 
Meeting, NATO Allies formally declared for the first time that the 
PRC's growing influence and international policies present `challenges 
and opportunities' that need to be addressed by the Alliance. In 
September, France, Germany and the UK submitted a joint note verbale in 
the U.N. against the PRC's claims in the South China Sea. We joined our 
G-7 counterparts in condemning the PRC's violation of the Sino-British 
Joint Declaration on Hong Kong. We have also seen European leaders, at 
all levels, reaffirm shared Transatlantic values of transparency and 
free speech by speaking out publicly about the PRC's aggressive 
disinformation campaigns throughout the COVID pandemic, as well as its 
human rights violations in Xinjiang, the repression of protesters in 
Hong Kong, and its hostile actions toward Taiwan. These are just a few 
of the indicators of that growing strategic alignment between the 
United States and our Allies and partners in Europe with regard to the 
PRC.


 Question. The Pew Research Center survey released this week shows 
severe declines in European views of the United States. Additionally, 
in all 9 European countries surveyed, the percentage of people who 
believe China has done a good job in handling the pandemic is more than 
twice as high as the percentage saying the United States has responded 
well to COVID-19. Is China's ``mask diplomacy'' in Europe succeeding?

    Answer. In light of European audiences' awareness of the origins of 
COVID-19, China's ``mask diplomacy'' has had limited effectiveness. 
European journalists have largely shown the PRC's ``gifts'' to be 
rooted in political opportunism rather than altruism. They have 
highlighted the low-quality of donated PPE and PRC attempts to leverage 
contributions for propaganda efforts.
    Pew's research does indicate, however, that PRC practices of data 
manipulation, censorship, and media control over international 
reporting within China, has been successful at misleading European 
publics as to the extent of their efficacy while obscuring the 
authoritarian actions they have used to clamp down on the spread of 
COVID-19.


 Answer. The United States remains an indispensable, committed 
partner of the international community, including at the U.N. and its 
specialized agencies and related organizations, and continues to be the 
largest funder of international organizations, providing over $12.2 
billion in fiscal year 2019. This Administration will continue working 
to ensure that respect for human rights, the dignity and worth of 
individuals, peaceful resolution of conflict, sustainable economic 
prosperity, national sovereignty, transparency, good governance, and 
the rule of law remain priorities at the U.N. and its specialized 
agencies and related organizations.
    The People's Republic of China has expanded its malign influence 
throughout the multilateral system, including the World Health 
Organization, to advance its own narrow foreign policy interests, often 
at the expense of the health and safety of the global community. The 
Department has been working diligently to push back against the PRC's 
problematic behavior and authoritarian ideology within the U.N. and its 
specialized agencies and related organizations and to strengthen the 
institutional integrity of these organizations by improving their 
transparency, accountability, and effectiveness.


 Question. Aggressive Chinese Diplomacy: In recent years, the 
Chinese foreign ministry appears to have instructed its embassies 
overseas to adopt a more aggressive tone against the United States and 
our allies. Called ``wolf-warrior diplomacy,'' this approach seems to 
represent a transition in Chinese diplomacy from conservative, passive, 
and low-key to assertive, proactive, and high-profile--and to reflect a 
sense of increasing nationalism within China. We have seen an increased 
willingness among Chinese ambassadors to engage in public speaking and 
publish op-eds in an effort to push significant disinformation 
campaigns that attack the West and promote a version of Chinese 
economic, political, and diplomatic engagement that is disconnected 
from reality:
    What is the Department's observation about the effectiveness of 
this Chinese campaign?

    Answer. Chinese diplomats have indeed grown more strident and 
aggressive in their public and private remarks, both at home and in 
third countries. The German Marshall Fund has found that, since the 
first Hong Kong protests erupted in March 2019, Twitter accounts 
connected to PRC Embassies, Consulates, and Ambassadors have increased 
250 percent. This is in stark contrast to the PRC's censorship of 
social media at home, including outright blocking of platforms like 
Twitter and Facebook. This newfound aggression in seeking to control 
the information narrative has been matched by diplomatic aggression--to 
include outright threats against third counties' sovereignty, security, 
and economic well-being. However, in most cases these attempts have not 
resulted in the cowing of foreign leaders or publics.
    To the contrary, this belligerence has revealed CCP malign intent 
more clearly to a global audience, and most countries have responded by 
publicly rejecting Beijing's increasingly threatening approach. In 
addition to not bowing to Beijing's demands, public opinion polls 
reveal a souring of views of the Chinese government's tone and behavior 
in more and more countries. In particular, countries' rejection of the 
PRC's cover-up of COVID-19, disinformation efforts around its origins 
and spread, and transactional approach to medical supplies, have 
further exposed the limits of Beijing's aggressive diplomatic efforts.

  Question. What is the State Department's strategy for counteracting 
wolf-warrior diplomacy?

    Answer. The Department's tracking of Beijing's so-called ``wolf-
warrior'' diplomacy has shown this strategy often backfires, angering 
the very audiences Beijing hopes to influence. For example, Global 
Engagement Center analysis of Foreign Minister Wang Yi's recent trip to 
Europe showed that digital and social media conversations in Europe 
about the visit were predominately negative.
    The Department, however, is not just monitoring CCP attempts to 
influence global conversations. Across the Department and at our posts 
around the world, our teams are focused on sharing accurate information 
about the United States, our policies, and values while building 
resiliency to CCP propaganda and disinformation. Public Affairs 
Officers at U.S. embassies and consulates, working with their local 
staff, use their own media platforms, local contacts, speaker and grant 
programs, and a variety of other tools to ensure that local governments 
and publics see PRC aggression clearly. Beijing's ``wolf-warrior'' 
efforts work against Beijing--their threats against local leaders, 
companies, and publics almost always result in a strong and negative 
response in these countries, further raising collective alarm about 
Beijing's malign activities abroad.


 Question. What is the Department doing to lift the curtain on 
China's anti-democratic, neocolonialist diplomatic and economic 
engagement?

    Answer. We are working every day to raise awareness of the PRC's 
malign activities around the world. As mentioned in my testimony, the 
Department has reorganized and retooled to confront the global threat 
from the CCP in recent years, and every office and bureau is focused on 
this global foreign policy challenge. We recognize that messaging is a 
critical component of our campaign to reveal the PRC's malign 
activities abroad; this includes both private messaging to local 
governments as well as public messaging efforts.
    All of our diplomats in the field are empowered to speak on China 
issues, and are raising awareness of PRC malign intentions every day. 
The greatest tool in this effort is transparency: exposing PRC malign 
actions helps foreign audiences understand the threat Beijing poses to 
their country's own national interests and well-being. We are also 
eager to use the new Counter China Influence Fund (CCIF) to support our 
posts in their programmatic and messaging efforts to expose PRC malign 
influence. On the economic front, our posts are taking advantage of the 
many new tools at their disposal to provide alternatives to Beijing's 
predatory lending, including the Development Finance Corporation (DFC), 
which helps meet local development needs without resorting to Beijing's 
unsustainable lending.",Countering the Threat of the Chinese Communist Party: A Comprehensive Approach,"David R. Stilwell, along with colleagues from the Department of State, provides testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee on the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to the United States and the global order. Stilwell emphasizes the increasing aggression of the CCP globally, highlighting its various malign activities such as assaults on foreign entities, manipulation of international organizations, and spreading disinformation. He discusses how the Department's policy has evolved to counter the CCP's actions, focusing on areas such as public diplomacy, counter propaganda, and disinformation efforts. Stilwell underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach in addressing the CCP's challenges and outlines specific initiatives and collaborations to push back against its malign behavior."

But rather than accept his loss, Donald Trump tried 
everything he could to overturn the will of American voters. He 
and his allies filed more than 60 lawsuits with false claims of 
election fraud and lost all 60 of them. He waged a pressure 
campaign at every level of government--from county election 
officials to secretaries of state, to the Department of 
Justice, to his own Vice President--to try to prevent the 
certification of the election results.


 Yet today, more than 11 months after the election, the 
attacks on our election system have only intensified, and the 
latest weapon of choice is the partisan audit. Let me be clear. 
The hyperpartisan audits pushed by President Trump and his 
allies are not about fairness, election security, or the truth. 
They are instead designed to promote conspiracy theories and to 
raise doubts about our elections.


You cannot argue the question regarding election integrity 
from the right is an attack on our democracy, our 
constitutional republic, especially after four years of the 
Democrats claiming that the 2016 Presidential election was 
stolen because of Russian interference.
    Here is what a member of this committee said, Mr. Raskin 
from Maryland said, ``I would love to challenge the Electoral 
College vote because our election was badly tainted by 
everything from cyber sabotage by Vladimir Putin to deliberate 
voter suppression by Republicans in numerous swing states.'' 
That's what he said.


 Mr. Gates. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, Ranking 
Member, and members of the committee. Thank you so much for 
having me here today to discuss a very important issue in our 
country, and that's the future of fair and free elections.
    The 2020 election in Maricopa County, the general election, 
was the best election we've ever run in Maricopa County. And 
the way that I know that was it was the most scrutinized 
election in the history of Maricopa County. Election experts 
said that. Machine counts confirmed it. Hand counts confirmed 
it. The court system reconfirmed it, and our residents were 
happy, too.
    We did a poll of 80,000 of our voters, and 90 percent of 
them said that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the 
election. Really, by any measure, this election in 2020 was 
secure, and everyone who wanted to vote was able to do so.
    Unfortunately, some in our party see it differently. They 
have attacked the work that was done by our elections workers 
in Maricopa County, and they have fanned the flames of 
conspiracy. And this willingness to do so, unfortunately, is 
what led to the first nonpeaceful transfer of power in our 
country's history.


 The Senate then hired the Cyber Ninjas to head up a group 
of firms with no or little election experience to conduct an 
extralegal review, essentially an extralegal recount of 
Maricopa County's ballots. And really, that can only be 
described as an amateurish review of Maricopa County's election 
technical infrastructure.
    The Cyber Ninjas, they changed the policies and procedures. 
They chased conspiracy theories. They threw out false claims. 
And worst of all, they accused our good elections workers of 
committing crimes. They said that they deleted files, but these 
were files that the Cyber Ninjas just couldn't find. Now, this 
was either an out-and-out lie or a level of incompetence by the 
Cyber Ninjas that was staggering.
    Elections integrity is not a new thing for me. As a former 
Republican election lawyer for the Arizona Republican Party, 
it's a passion of mine. And that's why I'm here today to speak 
out against those that are passing off this disinformation and 
those that would call on legitimate elections to be 
decertified.


 But the bad news is that tens of millions of Americans, 
sincerely disappointed that their candidate lost, have been 
targeted in a scam to keep them angry, divided, and donating. 
They've been fed a constant diet of lies telling them that 
millions of their fellow citizens, half of them members of 
their own party, engaged in a massive conspiracy to deliver the 
election to the current President and that none of the millions 
of conspirators are talking.


 The Ninjas' conclusions suffered from the same flaws that 
afflicted the entire process. They made wild claims about 
voters who had allegedly moved, based upon an incompetent and 
discredited methodology and an incomplete commercial data base. 
Experienced election auditors confirmed that the Ninjas and 
their allies got nearly half of their numbers flat-out wrong, 
including failing to account for one-third of the hand-counted 
ballots.
    And despite the fact that Arizona was the best hope for 
those that sought to deny the election, the Ninjas' effort 
confirmed nothing. It merely demonstrated that even in a state 
with the smallest margin of victory among the swing states, 
highly biased and motivated individuals, bolstered by millions 
of dollars from unclear sources and nearly eight months to 
work, could not manufacture enough fake fraud to overturn the 
will of Arizona voters.


 First, after more than nine months and millions of dollars 
spent, the sham partisan review in Arizona has given us the 
same insinuations that purveyors of voter fraud myths have been 
pushing and that real election experts have been debunking for 
years. And it's no surprise. The contractors that the Arizona 
Senate chose to conduct this charade were biased from the 
start.
    Second, we cannot dismiss these foolish exploits out of 
hand because they are spreading and providing seed material 
that common actors leverage in their disinformation campaigns 
to keep the big lie alive.
    Third, all of society must do its part to protect our 
democracy. Congress can help by providing resources to help 
election officials defend against these attacks and by passing 
legislation to protect election officials, workers, and voters.
    The Arizona Senate's partisan review was conceived and 
executed by people who were the subject of pressure from former 
President Trump and his supporters to propagate fraud claims. 
From a State Senate meeting with Giuliani to a call from Trump 
to Senate President Fann to the voicemails left with the 
Maricopa County supervisors, who stood firm and did not call 
back, the pressure campaign did not let up.
    It was in this context that instead of choosing objective, 
transparent, and competent contractors, the Senate choose Cyber 
Ninjas. Doug Logan, the CEO of Cyber Ninjas, has authored and 
apparently still stands by a memo to legislators chalk full of 
debunked Stop the Steal conspiracy theories, including a viral 
claim against a former Dominion employee who had to go into 
hiding after a flood of harassment and threats.

 I hope that those colleagues who are saying that 
legislatures have a right to obtain the information they seek 
and that holding people in contempt for not complying with 
subpoenas is not an excuse to put them in jail, but rather, it 
is an attempt to effectuate the people's right to information 
will remember that this week and next week, as the legislature 
you belong to works to get information from material witnesses 
to the violent insurrection that led to the wounding and the 
injury of more than 140 officers and interrupted the counting 
of Electoral College votes for the first time in American 
history in the most sweeping violent attack on the U.S. Capitol 
since the War of 1812.
    So that is a point that people should keep in mind. The 
second point I want to make is you cannot bemoan the people's 
loss of faith in elections while you are spreading information 
and propaganda that are eroding the people's faith in 
elections. Now when there are real problems, all of us need to 
act to address them. But I don't think it is a fitting response 
to the situation to spread lies and propaganda and 
disinformation that are being refuted today by Republican 
witnesses and then say we have a problem with people's faith in 
elections.


 Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Madam Chair, for holding this very 
important hearing.
    My friends on the other side of the aisle claim that our 
democracy is strengthened when close elections are subjected to 
forensic audit by outside entities. And I think that all 
reasonable people would agree that if Maricopa County should 
have hired an outside entity to conduct a forensic audit of the 
Maricopa County 2020 Presidential election, then Doug Logan and 
the Cyber Ninjas should not have been the firm entrusted with 
that obligation.
    Why? Because the Arizona State Senate knew that Doug Logan 
and his business known as the Cyber Ninjas had absolutely no 
election or auditing experience or expertise, and they knew 
that Doug Logan was a well-known and notorious pro-Trump 
conspiracy extremist when they hired him to conduct the audit. 
Doug Logan and Cyber Ninjas were hired in a no-bid, sole-source 
process despite it being well known that Doug Logan was 
spreading false claims of election fraud on social media.
	 The Arizona Senate also was well aware that Doug Logan was 
spreading QAnon theory, racist QAnon theory, and they knew that 
Doug Logan was intimately involved in promoting the Stop the 
Steal movement that was key to inciting the January 6 
insurrection, which was a violent attack on the U.S. Congress 
in an attempt to overthrow the results of the Presidential 
election that President Biden had won by the popular vote and 
also in an Electoral College landslide.
	 The fact that the Arizona Senate entrusted their so-called 
audit to a partisan political hack like Doug Logan is revealing 
as to the true purpose of the so-called audit. The real reason 
why the Arizona Senate entrusted this process to Doug Logan and 
the Cyber Ninjas was to undermine public confidence in our 
elections while providing a false justification for efforts in 
Georgia with its infamous Senate Bill 202 and also in Arizona 
and other states around the country to pass laws making it 
harder to vote and easier for partisan officials like those in 
the Arizona Senate to subvert elections.
    And it has now been revealed that Doug Logan and the Cyber 
Ninjas took $5 million--excuse me, $7 million, over $7 million 
they took from private organizations connected to Donald Trump 
to fund their so-called audit. You know, America Project was 
one of those firms, run by Patrick Byrne, the former chief 
executive of Overstock.com, who has sought to overturn the 2020 
election based on unfounded conspiracy theories.


Mr. Welch. Thank you.
    And Ms. Ramachandran, can you explain why conspiracy 
theories and disinformation about the election, something that 
has now pervaded our society, are so dangerous for our 
democracy?
    Ms. Ramachandran. Thank you so much for that question.
    Conspiracy theories and disinformation are dangerous for 
our democracy because they lay the groundwork for legitimizing 
future attempts to sabotage elections to reject the will of the 
voters. And these sham partisan reviews, like the one we've 
been seeing in Arizona, contribute to that disinformation and 
those lies because insinuations are made. They're not backed up 
by proper evidence, and then they get picked up and amplified, 
as you've described, on social media.
    So, for instance, I mentioned that Shiva Ayyadurai, one of 
the people that was hired by the Arizona Senate to look at 
ballot envelope images in this review, he conflated the 
envelope images with the actual ballots. And so he made a 
presentation to the Arizona Senate in which he falsely stated 
each of these voters submitted two ballots, when he was 
describing these images that he was looking at in a data file.
    Promptly the same day, that statement was picked up by 
Arizona State Senator Wendy Rogers in which she said that there 
were double votes, there were double--duplicate votes, that 
sort of thing, on Twitter and insinuated that there was fraud. 
So that's the relationship between these sham reviews and this 
disinformation campaign.
    Mr. Welch. So a final question. In addition to having 
whoever is the candidates are accept the outcome of the 
election, is it time for us to have some rules that apply to 
social media with respect to the spreading of false 
information?


That is to you, Ms. Ramachandran. Thank you.
    Ms. Ramachandran. Thank you. Thank you for that question.
    In a report that the Brennan Center published a little bit 
earlier this year describing attacks on election officials, we 
made a number of recommendations for the problem of 
disinformation on social media. One of those recommendations is 
for social media companies to amplify the true information that 
is provided by trusted election officials so that they're not 
sort of drowned out by all of this disinformation.
    Mr. Welch. Thank you. I yield back.
    Chairwoman Maloney.[Presiding.] The gentleman's time has 
expired. He yields back.
    I now yield to the gentleman from Kentucky, Mr. Comer.
    Mr. Biggs. Madam Chair?
    Chairwoman Maloney. Mr. Comer, you are now recognized.
    Mr. Comer. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    If there were no irregularities, as the Democrats on the 
committee have indicated today, with the past election, I 
wonder if the Democrats on the committee would take back all 
the conspiracy theories that they spread about the U.S. Postal 
Service sabotaging absentee ballots. Because that was a 
mainstay in this hearing--in this committee for many months 
prior to the election.



 Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you.
    An audit, when run well, verifies the results of an 
election and assures voters that their vote has been counted. 
But this circus didn't meet those basic standards because it 
wasn't really an audit. It was a gaslighting exercise funded by 
dark money groups who want to promote the big lie and undermine 
confidence in our elections.
    This conspiratorial worldview also infects Republicans in 
my home state of Florida, where a pending bill in the state 
legislature would conduct a forensic audit of the 2020 
election, but of course, only in counties that Biden won. And 
this effort is especially puzzling, given that the noted Trump 
lackey, Governor Ron DeSantis, heaped praise on the 2020 
election process.


 Mr. Higgins. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    How dare we? How dare we? How dare the sovereign states and 
free Americans challenge the oppressive, omniscient authority 
of the all-powerful national Democratic machine? How dare we 
exercise our legal and constitutional rights to question 
irregularities of an incredibly significant election?
    We have thousands of affidavits signed by American citizens 
regarding very suspicious election irregularities on the days 
and weeks leading up to the 2020 election and specific shocking 
observations of electoral sabotage on Election Day itself. 
Well, my colleagues summarily dismiss the sworn affidavits of 
American citizens as liars and conspiracy theorists, yet an 
illegal alien crossing our border with a scripted plea for 
asylum taped to his head, he is seen as a paragon of virtue.


 Let me ask you this. Is it true that Cyber Ninjas found no 
bamboo fibers or watermarks placed by the Trump campaign on 
paper ballots or suspicious folds that show that ballots were 
fake or evidence for any of the conspiracy theories about 
changing the ballots that have been circulating online?
    Mr. Bennett. Did they do what about bamboo fibers, 
Congressman?
    Mr. Khanna. That they found no bamboo fibers or watermarks? 
This is one of the conspiracy theories.


  Mr. Khanna. Let me ask you this, Mr. Bennett, because, you 
know, we come from different parties, different views, but you 
seem like you are trying to do a decent job in terms of the 
election. And it is all we have in our democracy, and you have 
people really concerned about whether the democratic system is 
going to continue in the robust way that we have had for 200 
years.
    Let me ask you just two final questions, and you can answer 
them both. One, do you think that there would ever be grounds 
for a state legislature to overturn votes if a candidate for 
President wins the popular vote in that state, or do you think 
that is going down a very dangerous road?
    And two, do you think it is healthy--put aside being a 
Republican or whether you voted for Trump or Biden. Do you 
think all of this conspiracy theory is healthy for our 
democracy? I mean, we have a legitimate President. And when 
half the country is saying that he is not elected President, 
does that help America stay a great nation in the 21st century?


 Ms. Tlaib. Thank you so much, Chairwoman. Thank you so much 
to all of you being here. I think this is so incredibly 
important.
    I know that in my community, we witnessed firsthand the 
radical backers of the former forever-impeached President's 
attempt to prevent votes from being counted in one of the most 
beautiful blackest cities in the country, the city of Detroit. 
But we all know it didn't stop there.
    Ever since Donald Trump was voted out of office by an 
overwhelmingly majority of voters in our country, he and his 
allies, led on the ground by Arizona State Senator--Senate 
President Karen Fann, have sought to turn Arizona into the 
poster child for their efforts to push false election fraud 
claims that failed elsewhere.


 Mr. Becker. I don't know what the intentions are, but the 
effects of this are that it is actually deterring many people 
from voting, particularly Republicans, it appears, because they 
are believing a lot of these lies about--falsehoods about the 
integrity of the process.


  Mr. Stanton. Madam Chair, thank you for allowing me to 
participate in today's important hearing.
    I am very disappointed that Mr. Logan declined to appear 
here today to address questions about how the Cyber Ninjas firm 
was selected to conduct a multi-million dollar, month-long 
partisan audit. I suspect the reason he isn't here is because 
he does not have good answers, that his involvement is one of 
the reasons the so-called audit was a fraud from the beginning.
    Mr. Logan has a history of spreading baseless conspiracy 
theories about the election and may be one of the reasons why 
he was chosen to advance the false narrative by Mr. Trump's 
loyal followers in Arizona. I would like to walk through a 
little of that history right now.


 Mr. Stanton. Thank you.
    And I want to point out for the record that even the Trump 
campaign knew this conspiracy was baseless. According an 
internal memo prepared for the campaign in mid November 2020, 
Trump campaign lawyers stated that Dominion has no direct ties 
to Venezuela.
	 More recently, this summer, while the fraudulent audit in 
Arizona was taking place, Mr. Logan starred in a film called 
``The Deep Rig,'' which sought to prove that the 2020 
Presidential election was rigged against Donald Trump. In the 
film, Mr. Logan states without any supported evidence that the 
CIA or former members of the intelligence agency may be 
spreading disinformation around election fraud.
    Mr. Becker, is there any evidence supporting the theory 
that the CIA officers spread disinformation about election 
fraud? Any at all?
    Mr. Becker. There is zero evidence of that.
    Mr. Stanton. These conspiracy theories are all completely 
groundless, and yet Mr. Logan has publicly espoused them. If 
this was the person that Trump loyalists and Arizona Senate 
believed was the right person for the job, it is pretty clear 
that their goal was not to conduct an honest audit.
    If Mr. Logan were here today, we would ask him whether he 
still believes these conspiracy theories. We would also ask him 
how he could possibly conduct a fair and impartial audit when 
he has already made up his mind on the basis of debunked 
Internet conspiracy theories nearly eight months ago.


 So now, even after this huge audit, some of my colleagues 
are refusing to accept even their own biased audit, claiming 
that there is still uncertainty about the election in Arizona. 
Donald Trump is even claiming the audit showed he won.
    A nonpartisan fact checker rated that claim as absolutely 
false and gave him the designation of ``pants on fire,'' and I 
ask permission to put the statement and the article about it in 
the record.


 This committee will use every tool at its disposal to fight 
back against the lies and conspiracy theories that have been 
allowed to grow for too long in our country. I ask like-minded 
Americans, both Democrats and Republicans, to join us in this 
fight. We all have an obligation to stand up for the democratic 
values that we all hold so dear.

",The Spread of Election Disinformation: Undermining Democracy and Legitimacy,"This compilation of remarks from various committee members and witnesses underscores the persistent spread of election disinformation following the 2020 presidential election. Despite numerous failed legal challenges and audits, false claims of election fraud continue to proliferate, fueled by partisan agendas and conspiracy theories. The debate highlights the danger posed by misinformation campaigns to erode public trust in democratic institutions and sow division among Americans. Efforts to combat these falsehoods and uphold the integrity of elections remain critical in safeguarding the foundation of American democracy."

Whereas the Kremlin and its agents have exported corruption and malign influence 
        activities to weaken democratic institutions and foment conflict beyond 
        its borders;

Whereas Russians, particularly Russian youth, have used social media to debunk 
        state-sponsored disinformation and encourage peaceful demonstrations, 
        leading to a renewed crackdown against social media by Russian 
        authorities;

Whereas the Biden administration imposed costs for harmful foreign activities by

It also highlights the role of Russian citizens, especially youth, in using social media to counter state-sponsored disinformation and promote peaceful demonstrations, despite facing crackdowns by Russian authorities. Additionally, the resolution commends the Biden administration for taking actions to impose costs on the Government of the Russian Federation for its harmful activities, including imposing sanctions on entities supporting Russian malign influence activities, expelling Russian diplomats, and attributing the SolarWinds cyber attack to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR)."

 It's also vital that we understand these movements are not evolving 
in a vacuum. Particularly in an election year, we can't disregard the 
risk that anti-Government extremists--either wittingly or unwittingly--
may latch on to narratives and conspiracies propagated by Russia and 
other adversaries who seek to further social divisions. It is important 
that when we examine these on-line and amorphous networks, we are aware 
of the dangers of malign foreign influence campaigns.


 As the committee was created after 9/11, we must stay 
focused on the continued jihadi threat. Within these various 
movements, we are seeing the adoption of accelerationist 
rhetoric, with calls to target Government institutions and law 
enforcement, for adherents to commit acts of violence as a 
means of creating further unrest.
    We see this concept in White supremacist movements, anti-
Government groups, and some violent environmental 
organizations. This convergence of violent ideologies results 
in the sharing of tactics and propaganda and the spreading of 
misinformation and conspiracies, as well as the celebration of 
violence.

 The Proud Boys is a far-right neo-fascist organization that admits 
only men as members and promotes political violence.
    The group believes men--especially White men--and Western culture 
are under siege; their views have elements of White genocide conspiracy 
theory.


In general, they approve of the current administration, and 
so their anti-Government rage abated for a time. However, 
renewed conversations about gun control laws, stress from the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the mainstreaming of deep state and anti-
vaccine conspiracy theories, high unemployment rates, civil 
unrest in major U.S. cities, and the extreme divisiveness 
plaguing the upcoming election have triggered a recent rebirth 
in the militant groups.


 Some militants, driven by conspiracy theories, have already 
turned to armed resistance at re-open rallies and have taken up 
guns to protect business owners who want to violate stay-at-
home orders. Michigan has been one hotspot for such activity, 
and, in May, the State had to cancel a legislative session 
because of the armed threat.


 Renewed conversations about gun control laws and restrictions, the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the recent mainstreaming of ``deep state'' and anti-
vaccine conspiracy theories, high unemployment rates, civil unrest in 
major U.S. cities, and the extreme divisiveness plaguing the upcoming 
general election have triggered a recent rebirth in the segment of the 
movement that focuses on firearms.


 Anti-Government groups, driven by anti-vaccine conspiracy theories 
and the belief that the virus is a hoax being used to exert control 
over Americans, have, in some cases, turned to armed resistance.


 Recently, there have been a number of hoaxes, fake social media 
accounts, that claim Antifa is plotting violence against average 
citizens. One such rumor claimed that there were ``busloads of Antifa'' 
heading to small towns and suburbs for the purpose of terrorizing those 
communities. Armed militants gathered to protect these towns and 
neighborhoods, unaware of that they had fallen for a hoax.


 Between gun control issues, civil unrest, the stresses placed on 
the country by a deadly pandemic, conspiracy theories, anti-press 
sentiments, and a highly divisive election cycle, the Nation is one 
large event away from violence.

    While it appears that the preponderance of the on-line militia 
sphere is inhabited by far-right extremists, they are by no means 
alone. In a forthcoming report, we at Rutgers and Network Contagion 
Research Institute will demonstrate that on-line anti-police messaging 
on anarchist and other far-left social media spaces, such as on sub-
reddit forums saw exponential increases during the most recent period 
of civil unrest in America following the killing of George Floyd. These 
messages have broken into the mainstream including Facebook and 
Twitter. Memes advocating the murder of law enforcement, and slogans 
found on the internet such as ACAB, F12, 1312 used by the far-left 
appeared scrawled on the defaced monuments and buildings all over 
America. Assaults on and the murder of law enforcement that occurred 
during the recent civil unrest were motivated in part by the themes in 
these memes and slogans.\3\


 Yet there is a double standard in how on-line platforms 
treat content produced by White supremacists versus Islamic 
extremists. For the latter, de-platforming is the accepted 
strategy pushed by our Government, the Global Internet Forum to 
Counter Terrorism, and practiced by the tech companies. It 
would be inconceivable for social media platforms to allow ISIS 
propaganda to go unchecked or be monetized. But that is exactly 
what has happened with White supremacy.


 American law enforcement and intelligence agencies agree with CSIS. 
In August 2019, the National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) quietly 
added White supremacist violence to its mandate.\3\ In September 2019, 
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) declared White supremacy as 
big a threat as ISIS or al-Qaeda.\4\ DHS warned that ``White 
supremacist violent extremists have adopted an increasingly 
transnational outlook'' driven by connecting with ``like-minded 
individuals on-line.''\5\ DHS specified the sharing of the ``ethnic 
replacement'' idea, which motivated the Tree of Life synagogue, the El 
Paso Walmart, and the Christchurch, New Zealand, shooters among others, 
as particularly problematic. It is the favorite propaganda of 
accelerationist terrorist movements.


The current pandemic and protests for racial justice have propelled 
this movement's growth. In recent months, accelerationists have spread 
disinformation and conspiracy theories tying the pandemic to Jews and 
immigrants, whom they allege are responsible for COVID-19. In May, the 
FBI's New York office warned that neo-Nazis and other racist extremists 
were encouraging their supporters who had contracted Covid-19 to infect 
cops and Jews.\11\ In early June, the UK's Commission for Countering 
Extremism warned that neo-Nazis and far-right activists were telling 
their followers to ``deliberately infect'' Jews and Muslims.\12\ As 
Soufan Center's Senior Fellow Colin P. Clarke recently argued, 
``Accelerationists believe that the social upheaval they promote, which 
is viewed as a necessary prelude that will usher in the rebuilding of 
society on the basis of White power, has been made plausible by the 
scenes of illness and death dominating mainstream news coverage.''\13\


                 mass attacks and the great replacement
    In the last 2 years, we have seen mass terrorist attacks driven by 
White supremacy in the United States and around the world. They have 
been inspired in particular by the ideas of the Great Replacement, 
which argues that White people are being genocided in their home 
countries and replaced by non-White immigrants. This is now the leading 
propaganda point for White supremacists world-wide.


                   the internet drives terrorism
    At this point, it is well-accepted that White supremacy is as 
significant a threat for generating mass casualty terrorist acts 
domestically and internationally as other forms of extremism. Though 
good data does not exist on what inspires hate crimes perpetrators, it 
would be inconceivable that on-line hate propaganda didn't play a role. 
The answer to slowing its spread and reducing its influence lies 
largely in containing the proliferation of these ideas on-line. For law 
enforcement, knowledge of the on-line ecosystem and the often bizarre 
language and memes, is key to infiltrating accelerationist networks as 
they work to stop future attacks.


  Not so for White supremacist groups. Enforcement of restrictions 
and bans on these groups and their acolytes is much more haphazard, 
despite their proliferation of propaganda such as accelerationism or 
the Great Replacement, which similarly inspires terrorism. Until a 
deplatforming that came in the wake of GPAHE's report on Generation 
Identity released in early July, the group had dozens of chapter 
Twitter accounts. As of today, it continues to have monetized videos 
running on YouTube. Some of the ads are for political campaigns (not at 
the behest of the campaigns).
    It would be inconceivable for social media platforms to allow ISIS 
propaganda to spread and grow unchecked, or to be monetized. Beginning 
around 2015, Twitter implemented a mass suspension of ISIS and similar 
accounts.\35\ In 2016, major tech companies launched a shared database 
of ``hashes,'' or digital ``fingerprints,'' of extremist imagery so as 
to be able to identify and curb the spread of terrorist content on-
line.\36\ This work would ultimately become the joint tech company 
effort, GIFCT, which now has dozens of companies using its work to 
identify Islamic extremist material.


 As to the other mainstream platforms, the question now is, with the 
United States and other foreign government agencies arguing that White 
supremacist and Boogaloo propaganda is inspiring terrorist violence, 
and with the rise of world-wide White supremacy as a terror-inducing 
ideology, will these social media platforms treat this and similar 
material as they have ISIS propaganda? Or will White supremacist groups 
continue to get a pass for inspiring terrorism on-line even though 
their propaganda does so in the same way ISIS propaganda does?


 In mid-June, the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism put 
forth a set of recommendations for White supremacist content on 
mainstream platforms. It includes that: Dangerous and terrorist-
connected propaganda and groups must be deplatformed; policies against 
hate speech and posting by violent extremist groups need to be clearly 
defined to include White supremacist propaganda and groups; these 
policies must be rigorously enforced; deplatforming organized White 
supremacist groups must be prioritized, and White supremacy must be 
recognized as a driver of terrorism at the same level as Islamic 
extremism by GIFCT and the major technology companies; algorithms and 
search systems should never recommend White supremacist content; both 
AI systems and content reviewers must be trained to prioritize White 
supremacist material for removal; identifying White supremacist and 
other hate content should not be outsourced to civil society and anti-
racist activists; and there should be no monetization of White 
supremacist material through ads, and payment processors should not 
allow their products to be used by extremists.


 If we don't intercept how this propaganda is spread on 
mainstream platforms, where it allows for recruiting, I am just 
afraid that the next Christchurch could be around the corner 
anywhere, here or abroad.
    Mr. Rose. Thank you.
    Ms. MacNab.
    Ms. MacNab. I think we are facing an uphill battle here. 
You have social media platforms where people can basically push 
propaganda, they recruit, they are actively recruiting younger 
male members. But then, from that point on, they move into 
private groups. Then, from there, they move into places like 
Discord. From there, they cherry-pick who they think are 
serious actors and they move into someplace like Signal.
    Trying to police this I think would be impossible. If you 
got rid of, you know, the bigger groups, the bigger propaganda 
things on Facebook, you would put a dent in it.



",Addressing the Rise of Extremist Movements in the United States,"The testimony highlights the interconnected nature of extremist movements in the United States, including white supremacist groups, anti-government factions, and violent environmental organizations. These groups share ""accelerationist"" rhetoric, advocating for violence to create further unrest. The Proud Boys, a far-right neo-fascist organization, is discussed, along with its resurgence amid factors like COVID-19, civil unrest, and a divisive election cycle. The testimony also addresses the spread of disinformation and conspiracy theories, particularly in online spaces. It emphasizes the need for consistent action from online platforms in combating white supremacist propaganda, similar to measures taken against Islamic extremism. The testimony concludes with recommendations to deplatform white supremacist content and recognize it as a driver of terrorism."

 Ms. CHU. Administrator Carranza, I would like to touch on 
the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 or the 2019 novel coronavirus, 
which has had a negative impact on the small businesses in my 
district in Los Angeles. My district has one of the largest 
Chinese-American populations in the Nation, and I have heard 
firsthand of xenophobia directed at Asian-Americans and in 
avoidance of Asian-American owned small businesses, especially 
restaurants, but based on misinformation about the disease.
    And just as some examples, when this first started 
happening, there was a flyer that was handed out, and you can 
see here it has a gigantic ``fake'' on it because it actually 
dared to have the locals of the World Health Organization, the 
County of Los Angeles, and then said that there was a 
coronavirus outbreak and named five small businesses to avoid. 
But it was totally fake. And yesterday, CNN did interviews and 
articles with a restaurant in New York's Chinatown and it 
showed that it had no customers despite the fact that there 
were zero cases of novel coronavirus in the state of New York. 
And in fact, the restaurant owner said that now her restaurant 
is suffering a 70 to 80 percent loss of business. This is 
actually pretty typical of many of the Asian restaurants, 
certainly in my area, that caused us to have a press conference 
to say there is a lot of misinformation going on. Please do not 
believe it.
    The fears are misguided. The U.S. CDC says at this the 
virus is not currently spreading in the community of the united 
States and dispels many of the myths that are out there.
    So, Administrator Carranza, I think that the SBA can play a 
very, very important part in combatting this misinformation and 
supporting the small businesses that have been unfairly 
targeted. Would you consider offering an official statement 
urging SBA's resource partners and audience to combat the 
spread of misinformation that has resulted in xenophobia 
echoing what the official comments of the U.S. CDC is about the 
truth of the coronavirus?
	Ms. CARRANZA. Congresswoman, I will do something better. I 
have already called on my Disaster Assistance Preparedness 
leader to hold a conference with all of SBA on Friday. We are 
going to assemble a steering committee to anticipate what role 
can we play, and you have already stated, we can serve as a 
communicator. We have 1,000 offices. We have 2,000 executives, 
so we definitely have a strong voice and support communicating 
the truth and being very timely about it. So, on Friday we are 
going to address, as if we had a disaster, what proactive 
measures can we take. You know, what essential staff do we need 
to identify? Because our first concern is our employees and 
then our businesses and then, of course, any mandates that we 
have from the Administration.
    So, I look forward to working with you, especially the 
California perspective. And so, I look forward, again, to 
coming up with a strategy. But I agree. I think SBA could play 
a significant role, so much that we are going to launch a 
meeting on this Friday, this week. And we will keep you posted.
    Ms. CHU. Well, thank you. Yeah.
    Ms. CARRANZA. You are welcome.
    Ms. CHU. Thank you for that timely response, and hopefully, 
a statement can come out of it that dispels the misinformation.
",SBA's Response to Combat Misinformation and Support Small Businesses During COVID-19 Outbreak,"Congresswoman Chu highlights the negative impact of COVID-19 misinformation on small businesses, particularly Asian-American owned establishments, due to xenophobia. She shares instances of false information leading to significant losses in business. Congresswoman Chu urges SBA Administrator Carranza to combat this misinformation and support affected businesses.

The SBA will work on a strategy to address misinformation and provide timely information to businesses. This collaborative effort aims to protect businesses from unfair targeting and provide accurate guidance during the COVID-19 outbreak."

 Election officials have also recruited additional election 
workers, implemented other programs like curbside voting that 
would help make voting less of a health risk. Election 
officials have done all of this on top of the continuing 
efforts to ensure that this country's elections are secure from 
malicious actors who seek to attack voting infrastructure and 
spread disinformation. All of these elections and all of these 
actions have been taken to ensure that every voter can cast 
their ballot safely and securely in this year's elections. That 
is something that everyone here can agree on.


 Unfortunately, as localities prepare for the 2020 election 
and urge more Federal resources to hold safe elections, that 
legislation has languished in the Senate while President Trump 
and some Congressional Republicans have spread misinformation 
about voting by mail. The lack of urgency from our Senate 
Republican leadership, and I know you are trying very hard 
Chairman Blunt to get something done here, but the leadership 
is not giving us what they really need in providing these 
desperately needed resources. That should appall most 
Americans. John Lewis' mission was to restore the right to 
vote. The best way to keep his legacy alive is not simply 
giving good speeches on the floor, as important and nice as 
they are, but is to make sure that right to vote, even during 
this COVID crisis, is preserved, protected, and not stood in--
not abused.


",Upholding Voting Rights Amidst COVID-19 Challenges,"Election officials have taken significant steps to ensure the safety and security of the 2020 elections, including recruiting more workers and implementing measures like curbside voting to mitigate health risks. Despite these efforts, legislation in the Senate aimed at providing additional resources for safe elections has stalled. President Trump and some Congressional Republicans have spread misinformation about voting by mail, exacerbating the situation. The lack of urgency from Senate Republican leadership in addressing these issues is concerning, as it undermines the preservation of voting rights. Upholding the legacy of John Lewis, whose mission was to restore voting rights, requires ensuring that the right to vote is protected and not hindered, especially during the COVID-19 crisis."

 I think that we ought to think about this epidemic as 
though we have 3 of them. No. 1, we obviously have this big 
infectious disease epidemic. We also have an infodemic, which I 
am going to come back and talk about, which is a lot of 
misinformation and disinformation. Clearly, fear plays a 
predominant role in our community, a lot of it because we don't 
know what is going on. It is a new disease. There is lots of 
issues that--and, quite frankly, we need to strengthen the 
National leadership that we have had on this outbreak.


 We currently have 3 co-occurring epidemics associated with this 
crisis: The infectious pandemic; an ``infodemic'' of misinformation and 
disinformation; and an epidemic of fear. The epidemic of fear is caused 
by a combination of things: Fear of the virus, but also fear arising 
from the uncertainties around its spread and other unknown factors, and 
fear stoked by the poor and inconsistent risk communication from some 
political leaders.


The third issue is the ``infodemic'' I earlier spoke about. We know 
misinformation is rampant in minority communities. Some of it is 
purposeful. Early rumors that African Americans were immune from the 
disease as well as rumors about false treatments and cures are wide-
spread on social media and are even being spread via flyers and 
brochures. One example of a flyer that targeted the citizens of New 
Jersey in minority, Jewish, and Muslim communities is shown in the link 
in this testimony. This flyer falsely included the logos of the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health 
Organization shown here: https://www.njhomelandsecurity.gov/covid19. 
Similar flyers and disinformation more specifically targeting African 
Americans have been found in cities like New Orleans and on social 
media sites. In these cases people have been encouraged not to get 
tested or get the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. The 
disinformation often tells people that testing is being done to track 
people to give them the disease. Another widely-spread myth: The future 
vaccine will make one sterile. The anti-vaccine movement is amplifying 
these messages to others to discourage vaccine use. Many of these 
efforts are designed to build on existing mistrust of authority figures 
and create a sense of confusion and further loss of trust within the 
community.


Testing for the virus must be followed up by adequate contact 
tracing and sound programs for the isolation and quarantine of infected 
and exposed individuals. The use of culturally competent messages and 
messengers (including lay messengers, community health workers, faith 
community leaders, barbers, beauticians, and social workers) is 
critical to address the misinformation and other issues of concern. 
Communities should use more radio, social media, and age-appropriate 
vehicles for community health education. Materials should be prepared 
in a range of languages to reach people for whom English is not their 
first language (Spanish, Haitian, Chinese, Portuguese, etc.).


I think the third thing is, we have got to really deal with 
this issue of misinformation and disinformation. One of the 
things we did during the AIDS epidemic is we did a lot of work 
educating faith leaders, barbers, beauticians, anyone who was 
an influencer in our community to get to communities of color, 
to get to communities that had languages other than English as 
their first language, to make sure they understand the disease 
process and how they can get help, and what they can do to 
protect themselves. We haven't----
    Mr. Payne. Thank you.
    Dr. Benjamin [continuing]. Done that.


 Dr. Benjamin. Well, we should start recognizing that there 
is a disparity in vaccine uptake in communities of color. In 
other words, communities of color don't get vaccinated as 
frequently as Whites in this country. Second, we should 
recognize there is an enormous amount of mistrust that 
currently exists. That is coupled with, primarily, the anti-
vaccine community and others, though, who are sending a lot of 
disinformation.
    Look, we have already got people in social media space and 
passing out flyers telling community of color don't get 
vaccinated, it will make you sterile, it will give you AIDS, it 
will give you the disease, it will kill you. So there are 
already a lot of disinformation out there, and we need a 
National effort to do that.
    But, more importantly, we need a National plan. The Federal 
Government needs to step up to the plate and put together a 
plan, just like we did with H1N1, to figure out how we are 
going to deploy this vaccine. We have got lots of mechanisms to 
do that, but we have no plan.
    Ms. Underwood. Well, I am so glad you said that, because, 
last month, I introduced the Protecting Against Public Safety 
Disinformation Act. This bill would help public health 
officials mitigate the impact of false information that can 
undermine efforts to keep our communities safe during this 
pandemic and beyond.
    Dr. Benjamin, in what ways could the spread of 
disinformation worsen disparities, and the impact of COVID-19, 
particularly with respect to vaccines, but also wearing masks?
    Dr. Benjamin. Well, again, there is a group out there who 
is actively working to confuse us all around vaccines, around 
masks. Look, there are flyers. I saw some flyers that were 
being passed out in New Jersey which had the CDC and the World 
Health Organization logo on them. They were obviously 
misinformation, but they are flyers that basically said, you 
know, If you are infected, go to a synagogue. If you are 
infected, go to a low-income community. If you are infected, 
ride public transportation. In other words, they are trying to 
spread the virus.
    So they are giving misinformation to hurt people, and so I 
think we have got to push back against that kind of effort as 
aggressively as we can.


 For COVID-19, I do think that all the recommendations that 
we have made thus far still stand. In this case, I would just 
continue to emphasize the importance of a National strategy, 
because right now, we have seen what happens when we have this 
piecemeal approach across the country, when we have, 
unfortunately, elected officials who are not following the 
advice of public health experts, and, in fact, as Dr. Benjamin 
said, are feeding into misinformation.
    So everything that we can do, that all of you can be doing 
to ensure that there is a National strategy to the best of your 
ability would be extremely helpful, and to spread that 
information, too, or to counter the misinformation that is also 
rampant.


",Addressing COVID-19 Disparities: Combating Misinformation and Disinformation,"The text highlights the three concurrent epidemics associated with the COVID-19 crisis: the infectious pandemic, the ""infodemic"" of misinformation and disinformation, and the epidemic of fear. It emphasizes the need to address misinformation particularly prevalent in minority communities, which includes false treatments, vaccine myths, and disinformation campaigns aimed at creating fear and confusion. The importance of culturally competent communication, community engagement, and the role of influencers such as faith leaders and community workers is stressed. The text also discusses the disparity in vaccine uptake in communities of color and the spread of disinformation regarding vaccines and masks. National efforts, including legislative action and a coordinated federal plan, are advocated to combat misinformation and ensure an effective response to the pandemic."

 On the Financial Services Committee, where I serve as 
chairman of the Task Force on Financial Technology, we're 
seeing the use of AI and machine-learning technology to enhance 
international investigations to combat terrorism, financing, 
and money laundering.
    However, the evolution of artificial intelligence has also 
heightened the prospect that America's adversaries will win the 
race to develop and deploy AI, and to do so for malign 
purposes.
    To the great detriment of our national security, as 
reported by the National Security Commission on Artificial 
Intelligence, and this is a quote, ``AI is expanding the window 
of vulnerability that the United States has already entered. 
For the first time since World War II, America's technological 
predominance, the backbone of its economic and military power, 
is under threat,'' closed quote.
    Clearly, cybersecurity has become synonymous with national 
security, and our fundamental duty to protect our democracy 
requires that we become, quote, ``AI-ready,'' with resources, 
personnel, and strategies necessary to meet these urgent 
challenges.


STATEMENT OF HON. GILMAN LOUIE, COMMISSIONER, NATIONAL SECURITY 
             COMMISSION ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

    Mr. Louie. Thank you very much.
    Chairman Langevin, Ranking Member Stefanik, Chairman Lynch, 
Ranking Member Grothman, and members of the committee, thank 
you for the opportunity to testify today.
    Our report took a broad view of national security to 
compass economic competitiveness, as Eric has noted, as well as 
defense, as Bob has discussed, and wanted to focus on a series 
of cross-cutting national security problems related to AI that 
needs urgent attention.
    What these have in common is that our adversaries are 
aiming to take advantage of the free and open nature of our 
society.
    First, our society's digital dependency leaves us 
vulnerable to emerging AI-enabled threats. For example, 
adversaries are using AI to enhance disinformation campaigns 
and cyber attacks.
    They're also harvesting data on Americans to build profiles 
of their beliefs, behavior, and biological makeup to be used 
for tailored attempts to manipulate or coerce individuals.
    This is a gathering storm of foreign influence and 
interference, and requires organizational and policy reforms to 
bolster our resilience.
    You should stand up a task force and 24/7 operation center 
to confront digital disinformation. The government needs to 
better secure its own databases and prioritize data security 
and foreign investment screening, supply chain risk management, 
and national data protection legislation.
    We need AI-enabled cyber defenses to protect against AI-
enabled cyber attacks. And as the pandemic has made clear, 
biosecurity must become a top tier priority in national 
security policy.


  When I was running the DIB [Defense Innovation Board], we 
met a brilliant--we were doing a Russia review in the National 
Security Council--this brilliant young man who was busy doing 
cyber attack analysis, and I asked what was his career path. He 
said, next week I'm being transferred to a nontechnical 
position in another part of my rotation. That's insane, and 
that's how the government works. We need to address those 
issues, and those are covered in our report.


 Mr. Louie. This is a real threat to our critical 
infrastructure flow. As problematic as botnets are, AI-driven 
botnets are operating at machine speeds against our defenses, 
which have, still, people in the loop rather than on the loop. 
It's a losing strategy and it's clear to us that our 
adversaries are using not only advanced technologies like 
botnets, they're going after supply chain as with the 
SolarWinds attacks and they're also using it in disinformation 
campaigns.
    And the next step is to use disinformation campaigns 
against machines, to give machines and feed machines 
disinformation to make machines do the wrong thing. That 
adversarial AI is a real threat.
    Mr. DeSaulnier. And, Mr. Louie, just following up, there is 
a section that the commissioner recommends us passing in 
Section 4 of the International Cyber Crime Prevention Act.


",Urgent Action Needed to Address National Security Threats Posed by Artificial Intelligence,"The text highlights the increasing importance of artificial intelligence (AI) in national security and the urgent need to develop strategies to counter potential threats posed by AI-enabled technologies. It discusses the use of AI in enhancing international investigations to combat terrorism, financing, and money laundering, while also acknowledging the risks associated with the proliferation of AI by America's adversaries for malign purposes. The testimony from the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence emphasizes that AI is expanding vulnerabilities in America's technological predominance, posing significant challenges to economic and military power. Adversaries are exploiting the free and open nature of American society, using AI to enhance disinformation campaigns, cyber attacks, and data harvesting efforts. Urgent policy reforms and organizational changes are needed to bolster resilience against these threats, including the establishment of task forces and 24/7 operation centers to confront digital disinformation, prioritizing data security, and investing in AI-enabled cyber defenses. The testimony underscores the need for comprehensive approaches to address AI-driven threats to critical infrastructure and national security."

 Last year, the Ukrainians elected a political outsider who 
ran on an anti-corruption platform and pledged to push back on 
Russia's malign influence as president. Mr. Zelensky has got a 
difficult road ahead of him, and the United States and our 
European partners must be willing to assist Ukraine in 
countering the Kremlin.


 Putin has weaponized energy security, coercing governments 
by turning off or threatening to turn off natural gas. Cyber 
attacks are another weapon in Putin's arsenal of aggression. 
Many Americans were aghast that Russia intervened so 
dramatically in our 2016 election. None of our friends in 
Georgia, Ukraine, or Moldova were surprised. They have been 
dealing with Russian active measures and opportunistic 
politicians who take advantage of them for years.


 I started to realize that the grass-roots support for 
splitting from Ukraine might not be so grass-roots after all. 
The protests that were gathering in front of administration 
buildings and Ukrainian military bases were actually part of a 
massive propaganda effort that would become the hallmark of 
Russia's campaign to destabilize and dismember its southern 
neighbor.


  Could any of you really get a sense of the Russian people's 
view of this? Or is the propaganda that is there so widespread 
that they really do not have a view of this? Anyone? Mr. Nix.
    Mr. Nix. As you know, Chairman Keating, we have a fairly 
robust program in Russia. We cannot really talk about it. As 
you know, IRI has been designated by the Ministry of Justice, 
the Russian Federation, as an undesirable organization. As 
such, any communication with us, any work with us, can be 
criminally prosecuted.


Mr. Ostrovsky. I do not know if I can, as a journalist, 
really give recommendations to the U.S. Government of how they 
should deal with disinformation and propaganda coming out of 
Russia and the former Soviet space. But I think there needs to 
be a wider recognition of its effect, and the fact that it 
persists to this day, and that it is a serious problem.
    But we also need to talk about its limitations. You know, 
to talk about the question that you asked earlier, I think 
attitudes really have shifted. And I have seen interviews with 
Russian sociologists that say that a lot of Russians feel 
buyer's remorse over the annexation of Crimea and the effect on 
Mr. Putin's popularity ratings, which were bumped up a good 
year or two, those effects have now washed away and he is 
seeing some of the lowest approval ratings that he has seen in 
his entire 2-decade-long career as president.
    So while there is a lot of disinformation floating around, 
I think its purpose in a lot of cases when it targets us is to 
confuse the situation rather than push any kind of ideology by 
sending our various confusing, often contradictory narratives. 
And in Russia itself, you know, the agenda is usually to 
improve the Kremlin's and Mr. Putin's own ratings.


 You also mentioned, talking about Russian disinformation, 
you know, I have a Russian-created story about me out there. If 
you did not know, I created ISIS with John McCain actually, and 
there are people on the internet that believe that, and it is a 
real problem. You know, the reality is there is always going to 
be people that want to accept a conclusion that comports to 
their world view. The Russians exploit that, and I think it is 
wrong for any administration ever, under any party, to deny the 
seriousness of that undermining any kind of democracy.
    This is part of the Russian shadow war--the shadow war of 
misinformation, the shadow war of little green men, because 
they can say they are not there, is below the threshold kind of 
actions, whether it is cyber, whether it is space, whether it 
is putting people in there under a mercenary--the Wagner Group 
that supposedly Iraq did independently, but are not.


 Mr. Nix, what role does Russian propaganda and 
disinformation play in maintaining frozen conflicts in post-
Soviet countries? And how should the United States use 
organizations like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe to 
respond? In 1 second.
    Mr. Nix. Thank you for that, Mrs. Wagner. Well, certainly, 
Russian information plays a huger role in Ukraine and also in 
Georgia. In the Ukraine case, I would say this. It is 
definitely affecting public opinion in the occupied 
territories. People there watch nothing but Russian television.


 Ten years have passed. They actually celebrated an 
anniversary some weeks ago, and I can tell you that now with 
Ekho Kavkaza it is the only one that in many cases provides the 
alternative to anything that is developing on the ground. And 
people turn to it, even local ones, when they want to hear an 
alternative about the developments on the ground, because this 
is the only source of information made by the local journalists 
alternative to the Russian propaganda.
    So I would say that for me personally it is a very good 
example how you start despite difficulties and problems, and 
you still reach out to the other side. You engage with them, 
and you actually by--by giving them a chance to work with you, 
you are not fighting propaganda with propaganda. But you are 
working with them and you give them a chance to get good source 
information.


",Understanding Russian Propaganda and Disinformation in Post-Soviet Countries,"Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns play a significant role in maintaining frozen conflicts in post-Soviet countries like Ukraine and Georgia. These campaigns influence public opinion, particularly in occupied territories, where Russian television is the primary source of information. The spread of misinformation contributes to confusion and undermines efforts for peaceful resolution. While alternative sources like Ekho Kavkaza provide local perspectives, challenges persist in countering Russian propaganda effectively. Organizations like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe can play a crucial role in providing accurate information and offering alternative viewpoints to combat disinformation."

The United States has helped Georgia make real strides over 
the years in advancing democratic reforms and economic 
development, as well as in defending itself against Russian 
aggression. Georgia recovered after the 2000 war with Russia 
and with our support, has built resilience to continued 
aggression. Russia uses its occupation of 20 percent of 
Georgia's territory, economic leverage, cyberattacks, and 
disinformation to sew division and distrust and to try to force 
Georgia to abandon its Euro-Atlantic aspirations.
    The United States uses diplomatic engagement, assistance, 
and strong public messaging to push back against malign actions 
and to enhance the prospects for positive change. We strongly 
condemn the ongoing Russian occupation of Abkhazia and South 
Ossetia, and we support Georgia's sovereignty and territorial 
integrity within its internationally recognized borders. 
Georgia remains the United States' key strategic partner in the 
South Caucuses and an important partner in the wider Black Sea 
Region. Georgia has been a steadfast partner of NATO, and we 
continue to support Georgia's choice to pursue NATO membership 
and closer ties within the Euro-Atlantic community.


 While Georgia faces such challenges from outside actors, it 
also faces serious internal challenges as you have described. 
With U.S. assistance to bolster its efforts, Georgia has made 
significant democratic gains since independence. However, we 
agree that Georgia still has real work to do in strengthening 
institutions and democratic norms. Georgia's current political 
crisis is concerning both in terms of democratic development 
and the potential for increased vulnerability to Russian 
maligned influence.


 Georgia recovered after the 2008 war with Russia and, with our 
support, has built resilience to continued aggression. Russia uses its 
occupation of 20 percent of Georgia's territory, economic leverage, 
cyber attacks, and disinformation to try to force Georgia to abandon 
its Euro-Atlantic aspirations and to sow division and distrust. 
Russia's attempts to control and exploit the Georgian regions of 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia through borderization, arbitrary detention 
of Georgian citizens, restrictions of movement, and other measures 
threaten European security. They also endanger the lives and culture of 
people living in these Georgian regions.
    The United States is using diplomatic engagement, assistance 
programs, and strong public messaging to push back against malign 
actions and enhance the prospects for positive change. We remain 
committed to supporting Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity 
within its internationally recognized borders.


 The United States welcomes Georgia's successes thus far and wants 
to see Georgia continue on its path to a more robust democracy, with 
governing institutions that demonstrate integrity, have the capacity to 
counter Russian and other malign influence, and will allow it to 
achieve the European and EuroAtlantic aspirations of its people.
    While Georgia faces challenges in the region from outside actors, 
it also faces serious challenges within its own institutions and body 
politic. Georgia has real work to do in strengthening its democracy, 
both to meet the demands of its citizens and to stand as a proud 
counterexample to the Russian model of governance. Georgia's commitment 
to democracy and the rule of law is a fundamental element of our 
strategic relationship, as well as the precondition for the country's 
further progress.
    Over the years, U.S. programs have worked with Georgian Government 
partners as well as civil society to promote justice sector reform, 
judicial independence, and accountability. U.S. assistance also helps 
Georgia improve electoral processes, level the electoral playing field, 
and enable citizens to demand better representation. Support for civil 
society is critical to ensuring citizens are informed, can advocate 
effectively for positive change, and can maintain momentum on reforms. 
U.S. assistance in the media space similarly improves access to 
independent and reliable information, offers a diversity of voices, and 
helps counter Russian disinformation.
	 Another focus area for U.S. programs is better governance, to 
include support for government civil service reforms, local government 
decentralization, and transparency. Improved access to quality public 
services is one of the most convincing ways to show individual 
Georgians that democracy is working for them.
    With U.S. assistance to bolster its efforts, Georgia has made 
significant democratic gains since independence, since the 2003 Rose 
Revolution, and since the 2012 election cycle brought the current 
Georgia Dream ruling party to power. However, the aspirations of the 
Georgian people require continuous efforts to move forward in 
strengthening institutional integrity and embedding democratic, 
EuroAtlantic norms in the political rules of the game.
    Georgia's current political crisis is thus concerning in terms of 
the country's democratic development and the potential for increased 
vulnerability to Russian malign influence. While the current political 
impasse began after competitive but procedurally imperfect 
parliamentary elections in 2020, the roots of the crisis preceded the 
elections.


 Finally, I want to say a word about pressure on civil 
society and free media. These are essential elements of 
democracy. Georgia suffers from a significant deterioration in 
the ruling party's conduct toward respected civil society 
leaders and an increasingly polarized national media 
environment, disinformation, and misinformation, both domestic 
and foreign, fuel division among Georgian communities. The 
United States supports programming to strengthen independent 
and free media and counter disinformation through informed 
media campaigns, media literacy, and building Georgia's 
capacity to protect its own information space.
    The vulnerabilities I outlined play to Russia's interests 
and open the door for other influences harmful to Georgia's 
democratic path. Restoration of Georgia's role as a regional 
model of democratic development is becoming more and more 
urgent. We will work intensively to bolster its democratic 
institutions and processes. It is up to Georgia's leaders and 
political parties to restore Georgia's democratic reputation 
and earn the confidence of their constituents. The people of 
Georgia deserve no less.


 Finally, I want to say a word about pressure on civil society and 
select media, and access to information, all essential elements of 
democracy. Georgia suffers from a significant deterioration in the 
ruling party's conduct toward respected civil society leaders, and an 
increasingly polarized national media environment that undermines 
opportunities for compromise, power-sharing, and consensus.
    Disinformation and misinformation, both domestic and foreign, fuel 
division among Georgian communities. This is why the United States 
supports programming to strengthen independent and free media, and 
counter disinformation through informed media campaigns, media 
literacy, and building Georgia's capacity to protect its information 
space.
    The vulnerabilities I outlined play to Russia's interests and open 
the door for other influences harmful to the Georgian people's choice 
of a democratic path.


 Senator Murphy. What is the sort of status of civil society 
groups? And you say work to be done. How much opportunity 
exists to do works in the civil sector? I think a lot about the 
Global Engagement Center. We have been successful in growing 
the capacity to support organizations that are countering 
propaganda that are frankly just telling objective stories not 
influenced or paid for by foreign actors. What have we learned 
about our ability to try to open up that space in Georgia with 
U.S. aid programming?


 Ms. McDonald. Thank you for the question. You are correct. 
The civil society, the vibrancy of civil society is such a 
fundamental piece. It's a hallmark of democracy. And so we have 
invested with generous Congressional support tremendously in 
civil society and I would also say in free media. And I 
mentioned the media in my testimony in particular because it is 
an area where we see the best opportunity to help Georgia 
counter a lot of the disinformation and misinformation and 
propaganda that has been working to destabilize its society.
    USAID has quite a robust what they call a democracy 
governance portfolio. It is about $33.5 million of the $132 
million Eur-earmark. Of that, $8 million specifically goes to 
civil society. We in DRL also have just over $1 million. It is 
in HRDF, which is Human Rights Defenders Fund and FFF, which is 
Fundamental Freedoms Fund. Just over $1 million also supporting 
various programs in terms of civil society, helping build some 
of this public confidence, transparency, accountability between 
constituents and their leaders.
    The one thing I would mention on the media side, we also 
fund out of DRL six different regional programs of which 
Georgia is a part that works specifically to counter malign 
influence and propaganda. That program is oriented at 
bolstering truthful narratives, increasing access of 
independent media voices, proliferating those independent media 
voices, allowing them space and helping them gain space to 
operate, being able to understand and work within a 
disinformation environment, and protection of their information 
technology. So it is quite a robust program and I must say it 
is one that we are very committed to given the threats.


 There are a half dozen Georgians who are detained, 
essentially imprisoned, and so that is why we do have this 
process, the Geneva International Discussions. We are a party 
to those conversations. The next round will happen later this 
week. So I think in terms of the actual aggression, it 
continues. It is not a shooting war, but it is certainly a 
situation of intimidation.
    And the attacks, the cyberattacks also continue. The 
landmark one was in 2019, and we attributed it to the GRU. 
About 15,000 businesses and websites were affected. They were 
attacking Georgia with cyberattacks as early as 2006 and they 
continue to do so.
    So the Russian attacks are in cyber. There are economic 
pressures. There is the disinformation war. And then there is 
the occupation of 20 percent of Georgian territory.
    Senator Johnson. Which just underscores Georgia's main 
problem right now is Russia. And if they can agree on how to 
resolve their political differences, they would be in much 
better shape. Can you speak just a little bit about the 
multiparty system there? There are two main parties. How 
independent? How aligned are the various smaller parties? 
Either one, whoever.


",Support for Democratic Development in Georgia,"The United States reaffirms its commitment to supporting Georgia's democratic development and countering Russian aggression, which poses significant challenges to Georgia's sovereignty and Euro-Atlantic aspirations. Through diplomatic engagement, assistance programs, and strong public messaging, the U.S. condemns Russia's occupation of Georgian territories and stands firmly behind Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. While Georgia has made significant democratic gains with U.S. support, challenges remain in strengthening institutions, addressing internal political crises, and countering disinformation."

 This pandemic has also exposed the malign nature of the 
Chinese Communist Party. As the virus has spread, we learn more 
about the Chinese Communist Party's failure to respond and 
share relevant information with global health authorities that 
could have stemmed the spread. However, unfortunately, we were 
also briefed in January many times, and February as well.


 Actions taken now by the U.S. to instigate greater recovery 
efforts in the Western Hemisphere will showcase our commitment 
and desire to see the region prosper. Challenges originating 
due to the pandemic will continue to emerge for many months to 
come, but I am confident the pandemic can strengthen our 
partnerships with Latin America and the Caribbean.
    The United States must remain adaptable in our strategies 
not only to help contain the virus, but to right against 
exploitive transactional criminal organizations, as the 
chairman referred to earlier, and corrupted authoritarian 
regimes, as well as the growing and very malign influence of 
China.


  Mr. Camilleri. Fair enough, fair enough. Mr. Chairman, 
thank you. Obviously, this flies in the face of the refugee 
protections enshrined in U.S. law and international law. It is, 
frankly, also really disheartening on a human level. These are, 
as you mentioned, people who are literally putting their lives 
on the line to defend the principles that we claim to stand for 
as a country. It is hard to understand, when the Trump 
Administration has been so vocal about the condemnation of 
human rights abuses by the Ortega regime, how this sort of 
thing could have happened.
    And if you will allow me a final comment, this is precisely 
the kind of hypocrisy, or perceived hypocrisy, that erodes, in 
my experience, U.S. credibility in the region, and feeds the 
false narrative that the defense of human rights is simply a 
political instrument that we, as a country and as a government, 
deploy selectively against adversarial governments.
    When we do not practice what we preach, it makes it that 
much harder for us to defend and promote the principles that I 
think we do stand for as a government. So, thank you again for 
calling attention to this.",Addressing Challenges and Malign Influences Amid the Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has not only revealed the Chinese Communist Party's failures in responding to the virus but has also prompted the United States to take action to support recovery efforts in the Western Hemisphere. While challenges persist, particularly from exploitative criminal organizations and authoritarian regimes, there is optimism that partnerships with Latin America and the Caribbean can be strengthened. However, recent actions, such as the mistreatment of refugees, contradict U.S. principles and erode credibility in promoting human rights globally. This perceived hypocrisy undermines efforts to defend fundamental principles and values, hindering diplomatic efforts in the region."

        the security and integrity of United States democratic 
        institutions.
            (4) Lessons learned from other governments the institutions 
        of which were subject to a cyber attack, influence operation, 
        disinformation campaign, or other activity aimed at undermining 
        the security and integrity of such institutions, as well as 
        actions that could be taken by the United States Government to 
        bolster collaboration with foreign partners to detect, deter, 
        prevent, and counter such activities.
            (5) Potential impacts, such as an erosion of public trust 
        in democratic institutions, as could be associated with a 
        successful cyber breach or other activity negatively-affecting 
        election infrastructure.
            (6) Roles and responsibilities of the Secretary, the 
        Chairman, and the heads of other Federal entities and non-

        disbursement by a foreign national (as defined in section 
        319(b)) prohibited under such section.''.

SEC. 4203. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On January 6, 2017, the Office of the Director of 
        National Intelligence published a report titled ``Assessing 
        Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections'', 
        noting that ``Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an 
        influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential 
        election ***''. Moscow's influence campaign followed a Russian 
        messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operation--
        such as cyber activity--with overt efforts by Russian 
        Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party 
        intermediaries, and paid social media users or ``trolls''.
            (2) On November 24, 2016, The Washington Post reported 
        findings from 2 teams of independent researchers that concluded 
        Russians ``exploited American-made technology platforms to 
        attack U.S. democracy at a particularly vulnerable moment *** 
        as part of a broadly effective strategy of sowing distrust in 
        U.S. democracy and its leaders.''.
            (3) Findings from a 2017 study on the manipulation of 
        public opinion through social media conducted by the 
        Computational Propaganda Research Project at the Oxford 
        Internet Institute found that the Kremlin is using pro-Russian 
        bots to manipulate public discourse to a highly targeted 
        audience. With a sample of nearly 1,300,000 tweets, researchers 
        found that in the 2016 election's 3 decisive States, propaganda 
        constituted 40 percent of the sampled election-related tweets 
        that went to Pennsylvanians, 34 percent to Michigan voters, and 
        30 percent to those in Wisconsin. In other swing States, the 
        figure reached 42 percent in Missouri, 41 percent in Florida, 
        40 percent in North Carolina, 38 percent in Colorado, and 35 
        percent in Ohio.

	 (7) The reach of a few large internet platforms--larger 
        than any broadcast, satellite, or cable provider--has greatly 
        facilitated the scope and effectiveness of disinformation 
        campaigns. For instance, the largest platform has over 
        210,000,000 Americans users--over 160,000,000 of them on a 
        daily basis. By contrast, the largest cable television provider 
        has 22,430,000 subscribers, while the largest satellite 
        television provider has 21,000,000 subscribers. And the most-
        watched television broadcast in United States history had 
        118,000,000 viewers.

	  (12) In testimony before the Senate Select Committee on 
        Intelligence titled, ``Disinformation: A Primer in Russian 
        Active Measures and Influence Campaigns'', multiple expert 
        witnesses testified that while the disinformation tactics of 
        foreign adversaries have not necessarily changed, social media 
        services now provide ``platform[s] practically purpose-built 
        for active measures[.]'' Similarly, as Gen. Keith B. Alexander 
        (RET.), the former Director of the National Security Agency, 
        testified, during the Cold War ``if the Soviet Union sought to 
        manipulate information flow, it would have to do so principally 
        through its own propaganda outlets or through active measures 
        that would generate specific news: planting of leaflets, 
        inciting of violence, creation of other false materials and 
        narratives. But the news itself was hard to manipulate because 
        it would have required actual control of the organs of media, 
        which took long-term efforts to penetrate. Today, however, 
        because the clear majority of the information on social media 
        sites is uncurated and there is a rapid proliferation of 
        information sources and other sites that can reinforce 
        information, there is an increasing likelihood that the 
        information available to average consumers may be inaccurate 
        (whether intentionally or otherwise) and may be more easily 
        manipulable than in prior eras.''.

	 PART 2--NOTIFYING STATES OF DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS BY FOREIGN 
                               NATIONALS

SEC. 4411. NOTIFYING STATES OF DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS BY FOREIGN 
              NATIONALS.

    (a) Requiring Disclosure.--If the Federal Election Commission makes 
a determination that a foreign national has initiated or has attempted 
to initiate a disinformation campaign targeted at an election for 
public office held in a State, the Commission shall notify the State 
involved of the determination not later than 30 days after making the 
determination.
    (b) Definitions.--In this section the term ``foreign national'' has 
the meaning given such term in section 319(b) of the Federal Election 
Campaign Act of 1971 (52 U.S.C. 30121(b)).

PART 3--PROHIBITING USE OF DEEPFAKES IN ELECTION CAMPAIGNS

SEC. 4421. PROHIBITION ON DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIALLY DECEPTIVE AUDIO OR 
              VISUAL MEDIA PRIOR TO ELECTION.

    (a) In General.--Title III of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 
1971 (52 U.S.C. 30101 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the 
following new section:

``SEC. 325. PROHIBITION ON DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIALLY DECEPTIVE MEDIA 
              PRIOR TO ELECTION.
",Safeguarding Democracy Act,"The Safeguarding Democracy Act is a comprehensive legislative initiative aimed at protecting the integrity and security of United States democratic institutions. It encompasses various measures to counter cyber attacks, influence operations, disinformation campaigns, and other activities aimed at undermining democracy. The act includes provisions for auditing and reporting on illicit foreign money in federal elections, as well as strategies for notifying states of disinformation campaigns by foreign nationals. Additionally, it addresses the prohibition of distributing materially deceptive media prior to elections, particularly targeting deepfakes. With a focus on safeguarding democratic processes from foreign interference and misinformation, the act seeks to uphold the principles of free and fair elections and bolster the resilience of democratic institutions.

                influence discourse''; and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (C) malign financial influence operations, 
                characterized as ``misappropriation of technology and 
                intellectual property, failure to appropriately 
                disclose relationships with foreign government 
                sponsored entities, breaches of contract and 
                confidentiality, and manipulation of processes for fair 
                and merit-based allocation of Federal research and 
                development funding''.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) Chinese information warfare and malign 
        influence operations are ongoing. In January 2019, the Director 
        of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, stated, ``China will 
        continue to use legal, political, and economic levers--such as 
        the lure of Chinese markets--to shape the information 
        environment. It is also capable of using cyber attacks against 
        systems in the United States to censor or suppress viewpoints 
        it deems politically sensitive.''.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) In February 2020, the Director of the Federal 
        Bureau of Investigation, Christopher Wray, testified to the 
        Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives that 
        the People's Republic of China has ``very active [malign] 
        foreign influence efforts in this country,'' with the goal of 
        ``trying to shift our policy and our public opinion to be more 
        pro-China on a variety of issues''.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) The People's Republic of China's information 
        warfare and malign influence operations continue to adopt new 
        tactics and evolve in sophistication. In May 2020, the Special 
        Envoy and Coordinator of the Global Engagement Center (GEC), 
        Lea Gabrielle, stated that there was a convergence of Russian 
        and Chinese narratives surrounding COVID-19 and that the GEC 
        had ``uncovered a new network of inauthentic Twitter accounts'' 
        that it assessed was ``created with the intent to amplify 
        Chinese propaganda and disinformation''. In June 2020, Google 
        reported that Chinese hackers attempted to access email 
        accounts of the campaign staff of a presidential 
        candidate.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) Chinese information warfare and malign 
        influence operations are a threat to the national security, 
        democracy and the economic systems of the United States, its 
        allies and partners. In October 2018, Vice President Mike Pence 
        warned that ``Beijing is employing a whole-of-government 
        approach, using political, economic, and military tools, as 
        well as propaganda, to advance its influence and benefit its 
        interests in the United States.''.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (6) In February 2018, the Director of the Federal 
        Bureau of Investigation, Christopher Wray, testified to the 
        Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate that the 
        People's Republic of China is taking advantage of and 
        exploiting the open research and development environments of 
        United States institutions of higher education to utilize 
        ``professors, scientists and students'' as ``nontraditional 
        collectors'' of information.</DELETED>
<DELETED>    (b) Presidential Duties.--The President shall--</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) protect our democratic institutions and 
        processes from malign influence from the People's Republic of 
        China and other foreign adversaries; and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) consistent with the policy specified in 
        paragraph (1), direct the heads of the appropriate Federal 
        departments and agencies to implement Acts of Congress to 
        counter and deter Chinese and other foreign information warfare 
        and malign influence operations without delay, including--

                position within the National Security Council for

                malign influence operations on social media 
                platforms;</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (C) section 847 of such Act, which 
                requires the Secretary of Defense to modify contracting 
                regulations regarding vetting for foreign ownership, 
                control and influence in order to mitigate risks from 
                malign foreign influence;</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (D) section 1239 of such Act, which 
                requires an update of the comprehensive strategy to 
                counter the threat of malign influence to include the 
                People's Republic of China;</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (E) section 5323 of such Act, which 
                authorizes the Director of National Intelligence to

                Threat Analysis Center to detect and study information 
                warfare and malign influence operations across social 
                media platforms; and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (F) section 119C of the National Security 
                Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3059), which authorizes the 
                establishment of a Foreign Malign Influence Response 
                Center inside the Office of the Director of National 
                Intelligence.</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 136. SUPPORTING INDEPENDENT MEDIA AND COUNTERING 
              DISINFORMATION.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following 
findings:</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) China is increasing its spending on public 
        diplomacy including influence campaigns, advertising, and 
        investments into state-sponsored media publications outside of 
        China. These include, for example, more than $10,000,000,000 in 
        foreign direct investment in communications infrastructure, 
        platforms, and properties, as well as bringing journalists to 
        China for training programs.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) The PRC, through the Voice of China, the 
        United Front Work Department, and UFWD's many affiliates and 
        proxies, has obtained unfettered access to radio, television, 
        and digital dissemination platforms in numerous languages 
        targeted at citizens in other regions where China has an 
        interest in promoting public sentiment in support of the 
        Chinese Communist Party and expanding the reach of its 
        misleading narratives and propaganda.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) Even in Western countries, China spends 
        extensively on influence operations, such as a $500,000,000 
        advertising campaign to attract cable viewers in Australia and 
        a more than $20,000,000 campaign to influence United States 
        public opinion via the China Daily newspaper 
        supplement.</DELETED>
<DELETED>    (b) The United States Agency for Global Media.--The United 
States Agency for Global Media (USAGM) and affiliate Federal and non-
Federal entities shall undertake the following actions to support 
independent journalism, countering disinformation, and breaking the 
firewall and combatting surveillance in countries where the Chinese 
Communist Party and other malign actors are promoting disinformation, 
propaganda, and manipulated media markets:</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) Radio Free Asia shall expand domestic coverage 
        and digital programming for all RFA China services and other 
        affiliate language broadcasting services.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) USAGM shall increase funding for Radio Free 
        Asia's Mandarin, Tibetan, Uyghur, and Cantonese language 
        services.</DELETED>

        language propaganda and misinformation.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) USAGM shall expand existing training and 
        partnership programs that promote journalistic standards, 
        investigative reporting, cybersecurity, and digital analytics 
        to help expose and counter false CCP narratives.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) The Open Technology Fund shall continue and 
        expand work to support tools and technology to circumvent 
        censorship and surveillance by the CCP, both inside China as 
        well as abroad where China has exported censorship technology, 
        and increase secure peer to peer connectivity and privacy 
        tools.</DELETED>
<DELETED>    (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized 
to be appropriated, for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026 for the 
United States Agency for Global Media, $100,000,000 for ongoing and new

technology to subvert censorship, and monitor and evaluate these 
programs.</DELETED>
<DELETED>    (d) Support for Local Media.--The Secretary of State, 
acting through the Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human 
Rights, and Labor and in coordination with the Administrator of the 
United States Agency for International Development, shall support and

influence operations abroad direct or directly supported by the 
Communist Party or the Chinese government.</DELETED>

Human Rights, and Labor shall continue to support internet freedom 
programs.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    (a) Finding.--Congress established the Global Engagement

                development methods or secrets related to critical 
                technologies; and</DELETED>

<DELETED>    It is the sense of Congress that--</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) the United States and ASEAN should complete a 
        joint analysis on risks of overreliance on Chinese equipment 
        critical to strategic technologies and critical 
        infrastructure;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) the United States and ASEAN should share

        <DELETED>    (3) the United States and ASEAN should work 
        together on appropriate import restriction regimes regarding

        its March 2019 proposed sanctions regime targeting cyber 
        attacks;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) the United States should urge ASEAN to commit 
        to the September 2019 principles signed by 28 countries 
        regarding ``Advancing Responsible State Behavior in 
        Cyberspace'', a set of commitments that support the ``rules-
        based international order, affirm the applicability of 
        international law to state-on-state behavior, adherence to 
        voluntary norms of responsible state behavior in peacetime, and 
        the development and implementation of practical confidence 
        building measures to help reduce the risk of conflict stemming 
        from cyber incidents''; and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (6) the United States and ASEAN should explore how 
        Chinese investments in critical technology, including 
        artificial intelligence, will impact Indo-Pacific security over 
        the coming decades.</DELETED>


<DELETED>    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following 
findings:</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) Sanctions and other restrictions, when used as 
        part of a coordinated and comprehensive strategy, are a 
        powerful tool to advance United States foreign policy and 
        national security interests.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) Congress has authorized and mandated broad 
        range of sanctions and other restrictions to address malign

ernance to benefit the CCP.
            (9) The PRC is encouraging other countries to follow its 
        model of ``socialism with Chinese characteristics''. During the 
        19th Party Congress in 2017, President Xi said that the PRC 
        could serve as a model of development for other countries by 
        utilizing ``Chinese wisdom'' and a ``Chinese approach to 
        solving problems''.
            (10) The PRC is promoting its governance model and 
        attempting to weaken other models of governance by--
                    (A) undermining democratic institutions;
                    (B) subverting financial institutions;
                    (C) coercing businesses to accommodate the policies 
                of the PRC; and
                    (D) using disinformation to disguise the nature of 
                the actions described in subparagraphs (A) through (C).

 (24) The global COVID-19 pandemic has intensified and 
        accelerated these trends in the PRC's behavior and therefore 
        increased the need for United States global leadership and a 
        competitive posture. The PRC has capitalized on the world's 
        focus on the COVID-19 pandemic by--
                    (A) moving rapidly to undermine Hong Kong's 
                autonomy, including imposing a so-called ``national 
                security law'' on Hong Kong;
                    (B) aggressively imposing its will in the East and 
                South China Seas;
                    (C) contributing to increased tensions with India; 
                and
                    (D) engaging in a widespread and government-
                directed disinformation campaign to obscure the PRC 
                government's efforts to cover up the seriousness of 
                COVID-19, sow confusion about the origination of the 
                outbreak, and discredit the United States, its allies, 
                and global health efforts.
            (25) The CCP's disinformation campaign referred to in 
        paragraph (24)(D) has included--
                    (A) concerted efforts, in the early days of the 
                pandemic, to downplay the nature and scope of the 
                outbreak in Wuhan in the PRC, as well as cases of 
                person-to-person transmission;
                    (B) claims that the virus originated in United 
                States biological defense research at Fort Detrick, 
                Maryland;
                    (C) Chinese state media reports insinuating a 
                possible link between the virus and other United States 
                biological facilities; and
                    (D) efforts to block access to qualified 
                international infectious disease experts who might 
                contradict the CCP's narrative.


 (14) to develop comprehensive and holistic strategies and 
        policies to counter PRC disinformation campaigns;


(13) Competition with the PRC requires the United States' 
        skillful adaptation to the information environment of the 21st 
        century. United States public diplomacy and messaging efforts 
        must effectively--
                    (A) promote the value of partnership with the 
                United States;
                    (B) highlight the risks and costs of enmeshment 
                with the PRC; and
                    (C) counter CCP propaganda and disinformation.

 (e) Countering Malign Influence.--In this section, countering 
malign influence through the use of funds authorized to be appropriated 
by subsection (a) shall include efforts to--
            (1) promote transparency and accountability, and reduce 
        corruption, including in governance structures targeted by the 
        malign influence of the Chinese Communist Party;
            (2) support civil society and independent media to raise 
        awareness of and increase transparency regarding the negative 
        impact of activities related to the Belt and Road Initiative 
        and associated initiatives;
            (3) counter transnational criminal networks that benefit, 
        or benefit from, the malign influence of the Chinese Communist 
        Party;
            (4) encourage economic development structures that help 
        protect against predatory lending schemes, including support 
        for market-based alternatives in key economic sectors, such as 
        digital economy, energy, and infrastructure;
            (5) counter activities that provide undue influence to the 
        security forces of the People's Republic of China;
            (6) expose misinformation and disinformation of the Chinese 
        Communist Party's propaganda, including through programs 
        carried out by the Global Engagement Center; and
            (7) counter efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to 
        legitimize or promote authoritarian ideology and governance 
        models.


SEC. 133. FINDINGS ON CHINESE INFORMATION WARFARE AND MALIGN INFLUENCE 
              OPERATIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In the report to Congress required under section 
        1261(b) of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization 
        Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115-232), the President 
        laid out a broad range of malign activities conducted by the 
        Government of the People's Republic of China and its agents and 
        entities, including--
                    (A) propaganda and disinformation, in which 
                ``Beijing communicates its narrative through state-run 
                television, print, radio, and online organizations 
                whose presence is proliferating in the United States 
                and around the world'';
                    (B) malign political influence operations, 
                particularly ``front organizations and agents which 
                target businesses, universities, think tanks, scholars, 
                journalists, and local state and Federal officials in 
                the United States and around the world, attempting to 
                influence discourse''; and
                    (C) malign financial influence operations, 
                characterized as the ``misappropriation of technology 
                and intellectual property, failure to appropriately 
                disclose relationships with foreign government 
                sponsored entities, breaches of contract and 
                confidentiality, and manipulation of processes for fair 
                and merit-based allocation of Federal research and 
                development funding''.
            (2) Chinese information warfare and malign influence 
        operations are ongoing. In January 2019, then-Director of 
        National Intelligence, Dan Coats, stated, ``China will continue 
        to use legal, political, and economic levers--such as the lure 
        of Chinese markets--to shape the information environment. It is 
        also capable of using cyber attacks against systems in the 
        United States to censor or suppress viewpoints it deems 
        politically sensitive.''.
            (3) In February 2020, then-Director of the Federal Bureau 
        of Investigation, Christopher Wray, testified to the Committee 
        on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives that the 
        People's Republic of China has ``very active [malign] foreign 
        influence efforts in this country,'' with the goal of ``trying 
        to shift our policy and our public opinion to be more pro-China 
        on a variety of issues''.
            (4) The PRC's information warfare and malign influence 
        operations continue to adopt new tactics and evolve in 
        sophistication. In May 2020, then-Special Envoy and Coordinator 
        of the Global Engagement Center (GEC), Lea Gabrielle, stated 
        that there was a convergence of Russian and Chinese narratives 
        surrounding COVID-19 and that the GEC had ``uncovered a new 
        network of inauthentic Twitter accounts'' that it assessed was 
        ``created with the intent to amplify Chinese propaganda and 
        disinformation''. In June 2020, Google reported that Chinese 
        hackers attempted to access email accounts of the campaign 
        staff of a presidential candidate.
            (5) Chinese information warfare and malign influence 
        operations are a threat to the national security, democracy, 
        and economic systems of the United States and its allies and 
        partners. In October 2018, Vice President Michael R. Pence 
        warned that ``Beijing is employing a whole-of-government 
        approach, using political, economic, and military tools, as 
        well as propaganda, to advance its influence and benefit its 
        interests in the United States.''.
            (6) In February 2018, then-Director of the Federal Bureau 
        of Investigation, Christopher Wray, testified to the Select 
        Committee on Intelligence of the Senate that the People's 
        Republic of China is taking advantage of and exploiting the 
        open research and development environments of United States 
        institutions of higher education to utilize ``professors, 
        scientists and students'' as ``nontraditional collectors'' of 
        information.
    (b) Presidential Duties.--The President shall--
            (1) protect our democratic institutions and processes from 
        malign influence from the People's Republic of China and other 
        foreign adversaries; and
            (2) consistent with the policy specified in paragraph (1), 
        direct the heads of the appropriate Federal departments and 
        agencies to implement Acts of Congress to counter and deter PRC 
        and other foreign information warfare and malign influence 
        operations without delay, including--
                    (A) section 1043 of the John S. McCain National 
                Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public 
                Law 115-232), which authorizes a coordinator position 
                within the National Security Council for countering 
                malign foreign influence operations and campaigns;
                    (B) section 228 of the National Defense 
                Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116-
                92), which authorizes additional research of foreign 
                malign influence operations on social media platforms;
                    (C) section 847 of such Act, which requires the 
                Secretary of Defense to modify contracting regulations 
                regarding vetting for foreign ownership, control and 
                influence in order to mitigate risks from malign 
                foreign influence;
                    (D) section 1239 of such Act, which requires an 
                update of the comprehensive strategy to counter the 
                threat of malign influence to include the People's 
                Republic of China;
                    (E) section 5323 of such Act, which authorizes the 
                Director of National Intelligence to facilitate the 
                establishment of Social Media Data and Threat Analysis 
                Center to detect and study information warfare and 
                malign influence operations across social media 
                platforms; and
                    (F) section 119C of the National Security Act of 
                1947 (50 U.S.C. 3059), which authorizes the 
                establishment of a Foreign Malign Influence Response 
                Center inside the Office of the Director of National 
                Intelligence.


SEC. 136. SUPPORTING INDEPENDENT MEDIA AND COUNTERING DISINFORMATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The PRC is increasing its spending on public diplomacy 
        including influence campaigns, advertising, and investments 
        into state-sponsored media publications outside of the PRC. 
        These include, for example, more than $10,000,000,000 in 
        foreign direct investment in communications infrastructure, 
        platforms, and properties, as well as bringing journalists to 
        the PRC for training programs.
            (2) The PRC, through the Voice of China, the United Front 
        Work Department (UFWD), and UFWD's many affiliates and proxies, 
        has obtained unfettered access to radio, television, and 
        digital dissemination platforms in numerous languages targeted 
        at citizens in other regions where the PRC has an interest in 
        promoting public sentiment in support of the Chinese Communist 
        Party and expanding the reach of its misleading narratives and 
        propaganda.
            (3) Even in Western democracies, the PRC spends extensively 
        on influence operations, such as a $500,000,000 advertising 
        campaign to attract cable viewers in Australia and a more than 
        $20,000,000 campaign to influence United States public opinion 
        via the China Daily newspaper supplement.
            (4) Radio Free Asia (referred to in this subsection as 
        ``RFA''), a private nonprofit multimedia news corporation, 
        which broadcasts in 9 East Asian languages including Mandarin, 
        Uyghur, Cantonese, and Tibetan, has succeeded in its mission to 
        reach audiences in China and in the Central Asia region despite 
        the Chinese Government's--
                    (A) efforts to practice ``media sovereignty,'' 
                which restricts access to the free press within China; 
                and
                    (B) campaign to spread disinformation to countries 
                abroad.
            (5) In 2019, RFA's Uyghur Service alerted the world to the 
        human rights abuses of Uyghur and other ethnic minorities in 
        China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
            (6) Gulchehra Hoja, a Uyghur journalist for RFA, received 
        the International Women's Media Foundation's Courage in 
        Journalism Award and a 2019 Magnitsky Human Rights Award for 
        her coverage of Xinjiang, while the Chinese Government detained 
        and harassed Ms. Hoja's China-based family and the families of 
        7 other RFA journalists in retaliation for their role in 
        exposing abuses.
            (7) In 2019 and 2020, RFA provided widely disseminated 
        print and digital coverage of the decline in freedom in Hong 
        Kong and the student-led protests of the extradition law.
            (8) In March 2020, RFA exposed efforts by the Chinese 
        Government to underreport the number of fatalities from the 
        novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan Province, China.
    (b) The United States Agency for Global Media.--The United States 
Agency for Global Media (USAGM) and affiliate Federal and non-Federal 
entities shall undertake the following actions to support independent 
journalism, counter disinformation, and combat surveillance in 
countries where the Chinese Communist Party and other malign actors are 
promoting disinformation, propaganda, and manipulated media markets:
            (1) Radio Free Asia (RFA) shall expand domestic coverage 
        and digital programming for all RFA China services and other 
        affiliate language broadcasting services.
            (2) USAGM shall increase funding for RFA's Mandarin, 
        Tibetan, Uyghur, and Cantonese language services.
            (3) Voice of America shall establish a real-time 
        disinformation tracking tool similar to Polygraph for Russian 
        language propaganda and misinformation.
            (4) USAGM shall expand existing training and partnership 
        programs that promote journalistic standards, investigative 
        reporting, cybersecurity, and digital analytics to help expose 
        and counter false CCP narratives.
            (5) The Open Technology Fund shall continue and expand its 
        work to support tools and technology to circumvent censorship 
        and surveillance by the CCP, both inside the PRC as well as 
        abroad where the PRC has exported censorship technology, and 
        increase secure peer-to-peer connectivity and privacy tools.
            (6) Voice of America shall continue and review 
        opportunities to expand its mission of providing timely, 
        accurate, and reliable news, programming, and content about the 
        United States, including news, culture, and values.
            (7) The networks and grantees of the United States Agency 
        for Global Media shall continue their mission of providing 
        credible and timely news coverage inclusive of the People's 
        Republic of China's activities in Xinjiang, including China's 
        ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity with respect to 
        Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims, including through strategic 
        amplification of Radio Free Asia's coverage, in its news 
        programming in majority-Muslim countries.
    (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated, for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026 for the United 
States Agency for Global Media, $100,000,000 for ongoing and new 
programs to support local media, build independent media, combat 
Chinese disinformation inside and outside of China, invest in 
technology to subvert censorship, and monitor and evaluate these 
programs, of which--
            (1) not less than $70,000,000 shall be directed to a grant 
        to Radio Free Asia language services;
            (2) not less than $20,000,000 shall be used to serve 
        populations in China through Mandarin, Cantonese, Uyghur, and 
        Tibetan language services; and
            (3) not less than $5,500,000 shall be used for digital 
        media services--
                    (A) to counter propaganda of non-Chinese 
                populations in foreign countries; and
                    (B) to counter propaganda of Chinese populations in 
                China through ``Global Mandarin'' programming.


SEC. 137. GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT CENTER.

    (a) Finding.--Congress established the Global Engagement Center to 
``direct, lead, and coordinate efforts'' of the Federal Government to

    (b) Extension.--Section 1287(j) of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (22 U.S.C. 2656 note) is amended 
by striking ``the date that is 8 years after the date of the enactment 
of this Act'' and inserting ``December 31, 2027''.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the Global 
Engagement Center should expand its coordinating capacity through the 
exchange of liaison officers with Federal departments and agencies that 
manage aspects of identifying and countering foreign disinformation, 
including the National Counterterrorism Center at the Office of the 
Director of National Intelligence and from combatant commands.
    (d) Hiring Authority.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, 
the Secretary of State, during the five year period beginning on the 
date of the enactment of this Act and solely to carry out functions of 
the Global Engagement Center, may--
            (1) appoint employees without regard to the provisions of 
        title 5, United States Code, regarding appointments in the 
        competitive service; and
            (2) fix the basic compensation of such employees without 
        regard to chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of such 
        title regarding classification and General Schedule pay rates.
    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2022 for the Global 
Engagement Center to counter foreign state and non-state sponsored 
propaganda and disinformation.


SEC. 206. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ENHANCING UNITED STATES-ASEAN 
              COOPERATION ON TECHNOLOGY ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THE 
              PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States and ASEAN should complete a joint 
        analysis on risks of overreliance on Chinese equipment critical 
        to strategic technologies and critical infrastructure;
            (2) the United States and ASEAN should share information 
        about and collaborate on screening Chinese investments in 
        strategic technology sectors and critical infrastructure;
            (3) the United States and ASEAN should work together on 
        appropriate import restriction regimes regarding Chinese 
        exports of surveillance technologies;
            (4) the United States should urge ASEAN to adopt its March 
        2019 proposed sanctions regime targeting cyber attacks;
            (5) the United States should urge ASEAN to commit to the 
        September 2019 principles signed by 28 countries regarding 
        ``Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace'', a set 
        of commitments that support the ``rules-based international 
        order, affirm the applicability of international law to state-
        on-state behavior, adherence to voluntary norms of responsible 
        state behavior in peacetime, and the development and 
        implementation of practical confidence building measures to 
        help reduce the risk of conflict stemming from cyber 
        incidents''; and
            (6) the United States and ASEAN should explore how Chinese 
        investments in critical technology, including artificial 
        intelligence, will impact Indo-Pacific security over the coming 
        decades.

 (5) an account of efforts by the PRC to cooperate with, 
        impede, or obstruct any inquiry or investigation to determine 
        the source and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus, including into 
        a possible lab leak, or to create or spread misinformation or 
        disinformation regarding the source and transmission of SARS-
        CoV-2 virus by the PRC or CCP, including by national and local

 Mr. Condon. From the HSI perspective, social media and 
maybe misinformation on social media is a challenge. It is 
something that I think many agencies are dealing with and we 
are kind-of coping with that and developing strategies. But 
also similar to what Mr. Russo is doing, we work hand-in-hand 
with CBP and Central America to eliminate or mitigate much of 
that corrupt focus and to work with our vetted teams to try to, 
again, build that professionalization in order to, again, to 
keep those threats from coming to the United States. The more 
and more we do that, the less strain you are going to have on 
the U.S. law enforcement and its related organizations. That is 
the main focus for us. But the challenge for the social media 
and those types of things is a small drop in the bucket, but we 
are beginning to help train our TCIUs and others on how to 
combat that social misinformation, how to work more closely in 
the cyber realm. But it is, again, in the nascent stages. So, 
that would be--that is kind-of the main drivers at least on the 
international side to try to push and to try to work and 
mitigate that further down range before it gets here to the 
United States.",Addressing Challenges of Misinformation and Social Media in International Law Enforcement,"Mr. Condon discusses challenges related to misinformation on social media from the perspective of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). He highlights efforts to develop strategies and collaborate with agencies like CBP and partners in Central America to address corruption and professionalize law enforcement. HSI is also training teams to combat social misinformation and enhance cyber capabilities to mitigate threats before they reach the United States, aiming to reduce strain on U.S. law enforcement. These initiatives are in early stages but are key drivers in international efforts to counter emerging threats."

 Ms. Waters. Thank you so very much.
    I want to remind us that President Trump has repeatedly 
tried to undermine public confidence in mail-in voting by, 
among other actions, falsely claiming it will lead to 
widespread fraud and abuse. This is, to put it mildly, 
nonsense. According to an analysis by MIT, over the past 20 
years there have been only 204 cases of absentee ballot voter 
fraud, out of 250 million votes cast by mail.


Mr. Luetkemeyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And welcome to my good friend, Secretary of State Ashcroft. 
Great to see you.
    Today's hearing topic is very interesting and, quite 
frankly, very telling. Right after the Select Subcommittee on 
the Coronavirus was formed, the Republican members asked the 
chairman to hold a hearing on the origin of the virus, which of 
course is China, and the actions that allowed the virus to 
spread to the rest of the world. However, we were told the 
Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus somehow lacks a mandate 
to review the origin of the virus.
    Fast-forward a couple months, and a subcommittee that is so 
strictly limited that it lacks even the ability to discuss 
where the virus came from now has jurisdiction over elections. 
If there ever was a question as to whether this committee is 
100 percent politically focused, today's hearing is making that 
crystal-clear.
    This is not about election security, but about my 
colleagues on the other side's attempt to spread fear and sow 
doubt in the results of this year's elections before a single 
vote has been cast. It's about spreading misinformation, 
conspiracy theories, and manufactured crises ranging from the 
supposed sabotage of the Postal Service to the dangers of in-
person voting--dangers that apparently don't exist at violent 
protests or high-end hair salons.


 Mrs. Walorski. Well, and, Secretary, again, you're the only 
one on this panel today that's running an election. So, can you 
talk about the problems that ensue when you have the media and 
you have Democrats out there telling people that if they go 
vote in person it's going to kill them? Just from the 
experience that you've had and in that false scenario that 
they're purporting, what kind of problems does that have for 
you when you're running an election in your state?
    Mr. Ashcroft. Well, the first thing is, as an election 
authority, I want to only put out true information to my voters 
so that they can make their own decision as to what they want 
to do, because it's their vote. And it is disingenuous and 
wrong for people to say that they want to protect the right to 
vote when they're lying to people about how their vote will be 
taken care of.


 Mr. Green. Thank you, Chairman and Ranking Member and to 
our witnesses.
    I, too, am concerned about the topic of election security 
and safety. In addition to the usual threats, including cyber 
hacking, foreign interference, voter fraud, the coronavirus 
pandemic poses a unique challenge. However, top public 
officials, health officials, say we can conduct in-person 
voting safely and securely, as Wisconsin and Florida have 
already demonstrated.


 House Democrats care more about winning the election than 
they do about election integrity. They want to centralize our 
elections under the all-powerful hand of the Federal 
Government, H.R. 1, and implement these flawed initiatives. 
This would make America's elections even more vulnerable to 
foreign interference and cyber hacking.


Mr. Raskin. OK. I'd like to ask unanimous consent to enter 
into the record a PolitiFact article dated June 9, 2020, which 
we've circulated to the committee. It has the title ``The 
misleading claim that millions of absentee ballots end up 
missing or in landfills.''
    This article makes clear that our colleagues' oft-repeated 
claim that 28 million mail-in ballots went missing is 
``misleading,'' quote, ``a mischaracterization,'' quote, and, 
quote, ``mostly false.'' In fact, the vast majority of, these 
ballots were mailed to voters but were simply never filled out 
and returned. As the article states, ``It's more accurate to 
refer to them as uncast or unreturned. There is no evidence 
these ballots led to fraud.''


This is Dr. Fauci from just about an hour ago: Quote, ``No. 
No, I didn't. I didn't get any sense that he was distorting 
anything. In my discussions with him, they were always 
straightforward about the concerns that we had. We related that 
to him. When he would go out, I'd hear him discussing the same 
sort of things. He led off and say, we just got through with 
the briefing with the group from the task force, and we would 
talk about it.''
    These suggestions that people throw out, anonymous sources 
that turn out to be debunked, I wish we wouldn't peddle in 
those kind of conspiracy theories. But I understand this is a 
hyper-charged environment, and I think it's important to point 
out the facts. We should be sticking to the facts.


 This is America. We love participating in democracy. We 
promote democracy. But we also believe in this peaceful 
transition of power. And that means we respect the results that 
we get, not denying the results of an election. Getting the 
results of the election on election night, and then continuing 
to move our country forward.
    So, with that, I hope we'll be able to work together on 
those challenges and address these other false issues that have 
come up to identify them as well.


",Polarized Perspectives on Election Security,"The hearing on election security becomes a battleground for contrasting views, with Democrats and Republicans presenting starkly different narratives. Representative Waters condemns President Trump's attempts to undermine confidence in mail-in voting, citing a MIT analysis debunking claims of widespread fraud. In contrast, Republican members accuse Democrats of politicizing the issue, spreading misinformation, and manufacturing crises to sow doubt in the election results. Secretary Ashcroft emphasizes the importance of providing accurate information to voters and criticizes false claims about the dangers of in-person voting. Meanwhile, Representative Raskin highlights fact-checking efforts to debunk misleading claims about absentee ballots. Amidst accusations and counter-accusations, the hearing underscores the deep polarization surrounding election security in the United States."

  In fact, no community is immune to the threat of anti-
Semitism, and that, unfortunately, includes areas I represent. 
Last year, weeks before Rosh Hashanah, anti-Semitic propaganda 
was found at Temple Emanuel in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, 
and later a car was damaged by gunfire outside the Chabad 
Jewish Student Center at Elon University as services marking 
the end of Yom Kippur were taking place.
    Unfortunately, anti-Semitic attacks in the United States 
have been rising, and the trends are similar across Europe. I 
can remember after the shooting at Pennsylvania on that 
Saturday morning, I found myself at Temple Emanuel in 
Greensboro just wanting to reach out to my friends there and 
could not have been more welcomed by Rabbi Fred Guttman and 
Rabbi Andy Koren.


 In fact, no community is immune to the threat of anti-Semitism, and 
that unfortunately includes areas I represent. Last year, weeks before 
Rosh Hashanah, anti-Semitic propaganda was found at Temple Emanuel in 
Winston-Salem and later, a car was damaged by gunfire outside the 
Chabad Jewish Student Center at Elon University as services marking the 
end of Yom Kippur were taking place. Unfortunately, anti-Semitic 
attacks in the United States have been rising and the trends are 
similar across Europe.
    Anti-Semitic incidents in the United States demonstrate a variety 
of ideological motivations. The attacker at the Tree of Life synagogue 
was motivated by white nationalist beliefs, the Jersey City attackers 
were connected to the Black Hebrew Israelite movement, and no clear 
ideological motivation has been identified for several of the attacks 
and slurs against Jews in New York City during December 2019. An attack 
on any faith is an attack on the faithful. Violent attacks and hate 
crimes must be explicitly and soundly condemned.


  ADL's immediate research, within hours of the incident, determined 
that the alleged gunman may have posted a white supremacist letter/
manifesto to the document-sharing site PasteBin on the morning of the 
attack.\10\ The post, in which a user identifies himself with the same 
name as the alleged gunman, details his hatred for Jews and all non-
Christians, and refers admiringly to the alleged Pittsburgh shooter as 
well as the gunman who murdered over 50 people who were praying at two 
mosques in March 2019 in Christchurch, New Zealand. The letter includes 
a laundry list of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, among them the 
long-standing white supremacist assertion that Jews are orchestrating 
non-white immigration which ``threatens'' the white race. ``Every Jew 
is responsible for the meticulously planned genocide of the European 
race,'' the letter states, adding ``for these crimes they deserve 
nothing but hell.''


  In the days following the shooting, ADL's Center on Extremism 
uncovered more disturbing details of the alleged shooter's ideology 
through various social media accounts he appears to have used.\11\ 
Numerous posts in a Facebook account illustrate his hatred for Jews, 
whom he sometimes refers to as Khazars--a reference to an anti-Semitic 
conspiracy theory that modern Jews are descendants of an Eastern 
European tribe from the eleventh century. In July 2015, he wrote, 
``Brooklyn is full of NAZIS--ASHKE-NAZIS (KHAZARS).'' (``Ashkenazi'' is 
the name of a Jewish ethnic group, which includes many Hassidic and 
ultra-Orthodox Jews.) He went on to allege that Jews were responsible 
for murdering black men because ``the police are their hand now.''


 \14\ ADL, New Hate and Old: The Changing Face of American White 
Supremacy (https://www.adl.org/new-hate-and-old).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Of the 249 anti-Semitic incidents in our 2018 Audit attributable to 
hate groups or extremists, most of these were perpetrated by white 
supremacists. For example, 142 of them took the form of anti-Semitic 
fliers and/or banners, which are categorized as harassment. The flier 
distributions are designed not only to spread and normalize anti-
Semitism, but also to recruit new members, draw media attention and, in 
the words of the Daily Stormer website, to ``trigger the living hell 
out of Jews and their leftist acolytes.'' The vast majority of these 
distributions were part of coordinated campaigns by white supremacist 
groups, particularly Daily Stormer Book Clubs and Loyal White Knights.
    The Daily Stormer Book Clubs' 2018 fliering campaigns blamed Jews 
for: Justice Brett Kavanaugh's fraught confirmation process and the 
allegations of misconduct that he faced; the de-platforming of right-
wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on social media and other 
platforms; and the debate in Congress over gun control laws in the wake 
of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting in Parkland, 
Florida.
    The Loyal White Knights' 2018 anti-Semitic fliers blamed Jews for 
orchestrating an ``open border policy'' and accused Jews of controlling 
the Government, the media, and the criminal justice system. Loyal White 
Knights is one of the country's largest and most active Klan groups and 
is best known for distributing racist, anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, 
homophobic, and Islamophobic propaganda.

(https://www.adl.org/resources/reports/quantifying-hate-a-year-of-anti-

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Further study of anti-Semitism on Twitter found that, in the lead 
up to the 2018 midterm elections, tactics of disinformation were being 
used to spread anti-Semitism on the platform.\18\ In November 2018, we 
released a report from one of ADL's Belfer Fellows and University of 
Texas Professor Samuel Woolley, who studies how automation and 
algorithms are used over social media and other digital technologies to 
enable both democracy and civic control. The report, entitled 
``Computational Propaganda, Jewish-Americans and the 2018 Midterms: The 
Amplification of Anti-Semitic Harassment Online,'' found that nearly 30 
percent of accounts engaging in anti-Semitic behavior were in fact 
bots, and that those bots made up over 40 percent of the anti-Semitic 
content in that time period. The qualitative results found that for the 
Jewish public figures who participated in the study experiencing 
threats of violence and deluges of anti-Semitism had become part of 
their internal calculus for engaging in public life.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    More recently, we conducted a study of anti-Semitism on 
YouTube.\19\ For years, YouTube has officially prohibited content which 
promotes or condones violence or incites hatred against individuals or 
groups based on core characteristics such as ethnicity, gender and 
sexual identity, and religion. In June 2019, it updated that policy 
with specific prohibitions against ideologies like white supremacy, 
which asserts the superiority of one group in order to justify 
discriminating against or persecuting other groups. For the first time 
it also prohibited content which denied the existence of violent events 
like the Holocaust or certain mass shootings like that at the Sandy 
Hook elementary school.\20\


``Anti-Semitism'' is a term coined in 1879 by Wilhelm Marr, a 
German Jew-hater who wanted to make clear that even Jews who convert 
and/or assimilate should be regarded as enemies conspiring against the 
German nation and the Aryan race.
    In 1882, Leo Pinsker, a Jewish physician in Poland, came up with a 
different term: Judeophobia, which he called a ``psychic aberration.'' 
He added: ``It is hereditary, and as a disease transmitted for two 
thousand years it is incurable.''\5\

Turkey
    Since February 2017, Turkey's state-funded broadcaster TRT has 
sponsored and aired ``The Last Emperor,'' an anti-Semitic revisionist 
historical series that reached its 100th episode last December. The 
drama peddles anti-Semitic conspiracies and has been documented to 
trigger anti-Semitic hate speech and hate crimes. This Turkish 
Government-sanctioned anti-Semitic content is not only available in the 
United States via satellite, but also available with English, French, 
Spanish, Urdu, and other subtitles on YouTube, providing Turkey's 
Islamist strongman Recep Tayyip Erdogan with the capacity to 
disseminate anti-Semitic content and incite diaspora communities in the 
United States.\14\ In commenting about the conspiracy theories 
propagated in the series, Erdogan said, ``The same schemes are carried 
out today in the exact same manner . . . What the West does to us is 
the same; just the era and actors are different.''\15\

Iran in 1979, the 3,000-year-old Jewish community in that nation 
numbered about 100,000. I recall visiting Iran's chief rabbi. Above his 
desk, he had a portrait of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, whom he 
praised--effusively, though by no means convincingly.
    Over the years since, Iran's Jewish population has dwindled. Today 
it is estimated at under 10,000. Under the Islamist regime they are and 
will remain--at best--second-class citizens. Other minorities, 
including Christians, and especially Baha'i, suffer even more brutal 
persecution.
    Anti-Semitism constitutes a defining feature of Tehran's radical 
Islamist ideology. The clerical regime routinely calls for Israel's 
destruction, with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, regularly 
leading crowds in chants of ``Death to Israel!'' And while the regime 
often attempts to draw a distinction between anti-Semitism and anti-
Zionism, claiming that it opposes Israel but not Jews,\41\ its rhetoric 
and behavior tell a different story. The regime embraces classic anti-
Semitic conspiracy theories, demonizes Jews in official state media, 
and promotes Holocaust denial.\42\ On the eve of the 1979 Islamic 
Revolution, Iran's Jewish population numbered 80,000 to 100,000. Today, 
estimates of Iran's Jewish population range from 5,000 to 10,000.\43\


 Iran's view of Israel and Jews resembles the thesis of The 
Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the infamous anti-Semitic forgery 
published in the early 20th Century. According to the Islamist regime, 
Israel and Jews not only seek to dominate their neighbors, but also lie 
at the root of all the problems facing the Muslim world. Jews, in this 
conspiratorial view, secretly control Western governments, spurring 
them to advance policies that weaken the Muslim world and corrupt it 
with anti-Islamic ideas.
    Last year, for instance, a state-run Iranian television station 
broadcasted a music video portraying the Statue of Liberty with a 
Jewish menorah in place of its torch; the singer described it as ``a 
flame straight from hell.''\44\ Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said 
the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric against Tehran was ``written 
by Zionists word for word.''\45\ A headline in the state-run Press TV 
declared, ``The Zionists Tighten Their Stranglehold on British 
Politics''; the story proceeded to argue that Britain ``is unable to 
assert an independent foreign policy in respect to major foreign policy 
issues, notably with regards to Iran.''\46\ Iran's state-run media 
broadcast and disseminate world-wide, reaching millions of viewers in 
Persian, Arabic, English, and Spanish.


 The anti-Semitism of Iran's rulers and State-run media has a long 
history. In his landmark book, Islamic Government, Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini, the regime's founding father and first supreme leader, wrote: 
``From the very beginning, the historical movement of Islam has had to 
contend with the Jews, for it was they who first established anti-
Islamic propaganda.''\47\


 The United Nations also has a Division of Palestinian Rights (DPR) 
under the secretariat, the only division dedicated to a specific 
people. The division oversees the Committee for the Exercise of the 
Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, which frequently 
commissions anti-Israel reports and hosts anti-Israel conferences.\79\ 
DPR also oversees UNISPAL, a UN-funded anti-Israel propaganda 
machine.\80\ There is also the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli 
Practices, which makes no attempt to hide its singular focus on Israel. 
Extreme anti-Israel bias is pervasive throughout the U.N. system, 
including at UNESCO, the U.N. cultural agency, and at ESCWA, the Middle 
East regional group, which excludes Israel.\81\


  We know some of the most violent incidents, the shootings 
in California and in Pittsburgh, were centered around a 
conspiracy theory that probably should have never seen the 
light of day, but was the basis of their desire to enact 
violence on people.


 So something is going on, and I think to your point, the 
idea that conspiracism has now become part of the political 
kind of parlance is deeply problematic, and we see terms like 
globalists or open borders or all of the crazy intonations 
against George Soros that he is paying migrants to come from 
Central America.


 I do not care kind of what lever you pull. I care whether 
or not you push prejudice. So, indeed, in 2016 we called out 
candidates when they said things that were beyond the pale, and 
when you make claims that there is, again, a global conspiracy 
and you point the finger at only Jews as driving that, forgive 
me but that gets our attention no matter who is saying it and 
no matter what the consequences are of speaking out.


 Anti-Semitism manifests itself in many forms, well-
organized groups, lone-wolf actors, the deluded individuals, 
and everything in between. Anti-Semitism in all its forms, 
however, is steeped in ignorance and bred of muddled and 
incoherent conspiracy theories, some of which were discussed at 
this table this afternoon.


  Anti-Semitism manifests itself in many forms, from the well-
organized group to the lone deluded individual, and everything in 
between. Anti-Semitism in all its forms, however, is steeped in 
ignorance and bred of muddled and incoherent conspiracy theories, and 
while this has been the case for quite some time, it is more easily 
spread and consumed these days because of social media. For these 
reasons, a lasting solution to bigotry and hatred will never be 
grounded solely on law enforcement and heightened security. That will 
only be achieved when every citizen works collectively to educate each 
other and to reinforce our shared values of tolerance and unity. New 
York City and the NYPD will continue to be at the forefront of this 
movement.


 Coming from State law enforcement I recognize that these State laws 
often include attempt and conspiracy provisions, however, local and 
State law enforcement agencies commonly lack the resources to conduct 
these complex and long-term investigations. I'm happy to speak more to 
this issue in Q&A.",Combating Anti-Semitism: Challenges and Solutions,"The text highlights the pervasive threat of anti-Semitism in various communities, both in the United States and internationally. It discusses incidents of anti-Semitic propaganda, hate crimes, and extremist ideologies, emphasizing the need for explicit condemnation and concerted efforts to combat such hatred. Examples include white supremacist flier campaigns, online disinformation tactics, and the spread of conspiracy theories. The text also examines international instances of anti-Semitism, such as in Turkey and Iran, and the role of social media in amplifying hatred. It stresses the importance of education, law enforcement, and community action in addressing and preventing anti-Semitic acts and ideologies."

 Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Chairwoman. Thank you very much. 
Thank you to the witnesses for being here today. This is a very 
important issue.
    The global cost of ransomware has risen to $20 billion a 
year. Over the past several years ransomware attacks have 
increased at an alarming rate. Attacks like NotPetya and 
WannaCry have had devastating impacts to critical sectors 
across the globe. Just a few months ago, both the Bay Shore and 
Lindenhurst School Districts on Long Island in my district were 
hit with cyber attacks.
    I am determined to work with hospitals, schools, and small 
businesses in New York's Second District and across the country 
to improve their cybersecurity posture in the wake of 
increasing threats. I believe it now more important than ever 
to work with agencies like CISA, the Secret Service, and the 
Treasury Department to combat malicious cyber actors from 
targeting our struggling small businesses, health care 
institutions, and State and local governments. We must think of 
new, innovative ways to interrupt cyber criminals' ability to 
see this as a financially viable way of doing business.

 Just a few months ago, both the Bay Shore and Lindenhurst school 
districts on Long Island were hit with cyber attacks. I am determined 
to work with hospitals, schools, and small businesses in New York's 2d 
district and across the country to improve their cybersecurity posture 
in the wake of increasing threats


 Before turning to these points, I would like to introduce myself. 
As a reminder, I am here today in my capacity as a co-chair of the 
Ransomware Task Force. I am a retired U.S. Army Major General now 
serving as Vice President of Public Sector for Palo Alto Networks, 
where I am responsible for expanding cybersecurity and global policy 
initiatives for the international public sector and assisting 
governments and industry organizations around the world in preventing 
successful cyber attacks and protecting our digital way of life. Prior 
to joining Palo Alto Networks, I served as the senior military cyber 
advisor at the Pentagon and was appointed as the acting deputy 
assistant secretary of defense for cyber policy. Prior to this 
assignment, I served in multiple leadership positions in operational 
cyber assignments, special operations, and information warfare. These 
experiences provide me with a unique perspective on both the commercial 
cybersecurity marketplace as well as efforts under way across the U.S. 
Government to leverage technological innovation to solve critical 
cybersecurity challenges, including the threat of ransomware.


 Mr. Goulet. Thank you, Chairwoman Clarke, Ranking Member 
Garbarino, distinguished Members of the subcommittee, for 
inviting me today to speak on the cybersecurity challenges 
facing State and local governments. As commissioner of the 
Department of Information Technology in New Hampshire and the 
president of NASCIO, I am grateful for the opportunity to 
discuss cybersecurity, efforts to mitigate ransomware attacks, 
as well as highlight the vital role that State information 
technology agencies play in providing critical citizen 
services, ensuring the continuity of Government.
    Cybersecurity has remained the top priority for State CIOs 
for the past 8 years. My State and across the country we are 
observing a shift among Government leaders treating 
cybersecurity as a continuity of Government issue. But while we 
used to be concerned with theft of data and personally 
identifiable information, the nature and scope of cyber attacks 
today are aimed at crippling the functioning of our Government. 
Recent attacks on water treatment facilities and hospital 
systems have shown us how these incidents have progressed from 
digital consequences to sophisticated strikes designed to 
threaten the health and safety of our Nation's citizens.


 I know I speak for all of my colleagues around the country 
when I say that a dedicated Federally-funded cybersecurity 
grant program, like the State and Local Cybersecurity 
Improvement Act, is overdue and will strengthen our ability to 
defend ourselves from cyber attacks.
    Since the Act would also require State legislatures to 
match a portion of Federal grant funds, it would provide an 
increased incentive for State legislatures to make cyber an on-
going priority in every State's budget.


 It may come as little surprise to you that cybersecurity has 
remained the top priority for State CIOs for the past 8 years. In my 
State and across the country, I have seen a palpable shift among 
government leadership that IT and cybersecurity are not simply regarded 
as a technology problem but a key tenet to the continuity of our 
government. While we used to be concerned only with the theft of data 
and personally identifiable information (PII), the nature and scope of 
cyber attacks today are aimed at crippling the entire functioning of 
our government. Recent attacks on water treatment facilities and 
hospital systems have shown us how these incidents have progressed from 
digital consequences to sophisticated strikes designed to threaten the 
health and safety of our Nation's citizens.
    The threat environment we face is incredibly daunting with State 
cyber defenses repelling an estimated 50 to 100 million potentially 
malicious probes and actions every day. State and local governments 
remain attractive targets for cyber attacks as evidenced by dozens of 
high-profile and debilitating ransomware incidents. The financial cost 
of these attacks is truly staggering with a recent report from Emsisoft 
finding that ransomware attacks in 2019 impacted more than 960 
government agencies, educational institutions, and health care 
providers at a cost of more than $7.5 billion.


  state and local collaboration
    As the Texas ransomware attacks illustrate, under-resourced and 
under-staffed local governments continue to remain an easy target for 
cyber attacks. Due to the combination of a whole-of-State approach to 
cybersecurity and the proliferation of numerous high-profile ransomware 
attacks across the country, State CIOs have significantly increased 
collaboration with local governments to enhance their cybersecurity 
posture and resilience. In fact, more than 76 percent of CIOs reported 
increased collaboration and communication with local governments in the 
last year.


 Additionally, NASCIO was a strong advocate of the DOTGOV Act, which 
was included in the omnibus Government funding bill signed into law in 
December 2020. The DotGov Act transferred ownership of the DotGov 
Program from the General Services Administration to CISA, which 
officially took place last month, and reinforced the important 
cybersecurity aspect of domain registration. I want to praise CISA and 
the DotGov Office for their announcement last week to waive all fees 
for new DotGov registrations. The $400 annual fee had been a 
significant barrier of adoption for local governments, who remain most 
vulnerable to misinformation and disinformation campaigns. With less 
than 10 percent of all eligible local governments currently on DotGov, 
NASCIO looks forward to continuing our work with CISA to better improve 
the cybersecurity of local governments. Now more than ever, it is 
essential to ensure the American people are receiving accurate and 
authoritative information from their Government websites.


Ultimately, whatever the administration and Congress choose 
to do, there is no single solution or silver bullet. No one 
organization alone will solve this problem. Much like 
confronting election security threats or disinformation more 
broadly, there are a range of levers that Government and 
industry can pull to achieve positive outcomes.


For a few years, I have been stumping for a more coordinated 
approach across industry and Government that can bring defenders 
together, break the payment chain, and put some consequences on the bad 
guys either directly or have their landlords do it. But much like 
countering disinformation (and frankly cybersecurity in general), 
because of the cross-cutting nature of the problem, spanning different 
Government agencies with different authorities, with often competing 
priorities and mission sets, National governments to include the United 
States have struggled to make meaningful progress.


Ultimately, whatever the administration and Congress chooses to do, 
there is no single solution or silver bullet. No one agency alone will 
solve this problem. Much like confronting election security threats or 
disinformation more broadly, there are a range of levers that 
Government and industry can pull to achieve positive outcomes. And 
there are past successes in operational collaboration that can be built 
on to ensure future success. For example, drawing on the lessons 
learned from the Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election, a 
coalition of agencies, including CISA, the National Security Agency 
(NSA), the FBI, and others, built a playbook that first prioritized 
effective coordination across Federal, State, and local government 
agencies. Second, increasing Federal support and resources to election 
security stakeholders to improve defenses and response. And third, 
engaging the adversary to learn more about their operations but also 
disrupt activities where possible.


 Mr. Norman. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and thank all the 
ones that are testifying. I thank you for your time.
    Mr. Krebs, I was on a bank board for a number of years and 
they had a cyber attack. It was like pulling teeth to get them 
to, I guess, let the word out and to get help from others. They 
finally corrected it, but 2 questions.
    How can we get--and I understand the reason, because their 
stock price, the name, you know, their, I guess, relationship 
with customers that may be threatened if it had gotten out. But 
how do we--in your opinion, what will we do to have them at 
least get the word out and get help from a lot of different 
factors? This is, what, a $20 billion problem.
    Second, when an attack actually occurs, you know, if we 
have an emergency, we call 9-1-1. If you need the police, 9-9-
9, you know. If you need an ambulance, you know, we know the 
number to call. But what should a company do, No. 1, to get the 
word out and get help? No. 2, you know, what do they do when 
they are attacked? Because they are kind-of left holding the 
bag and not really knowing who to go to or what expert that 
could solve the problem. Can you shed some light on that?


Mr. Davis. Congresswoman, I agree with Chris Krebs on this. 
I will just tell you from the perspectives of my experience in 
Government, including now in the private sector, it is a blurry 
world out there in this murky cyber-related business between 
state and non-state actors. I believe that states now see an 
opportunity to leverage non-state entities in a variety of ways 
to fundamentally undermine and gain an advantage over Western 
democracies in general, not just the United States. This is in 
the area that you have covered in terms of misinformation and 
disinformation, but it is also in ways to circumvent sanctions. 
These have been through the specific capabilities associated 
with ransomware. We have seen various states now that have 
begun to embrace this idea of leveraging these other entities, 
criminal entities and others, in order to undermine democracy. 
I think that what we are seeing is this is just another reason 
why the task force has taken the position that you all seem to 
agree with, this is now a National security-related threat.


 Mr. Goulet. Well, thank you.
    Well, with the, what I call the Diaspora, with all the 
people, you know, moving home to work early last year, where 
the attack surfaces for any cyber attack just massively 
increased because of, you know, where basically people's home 
networks became part of our State networks as part of that. 
Really the criticality of these systems became so much more 
important, particularly like our unemployment systems or our 
case management systems, where we use them for contact tracing 
and vaccinations.",Enhancing Cybersecurity in Critical Sectors,"The escalating threat posed by ransomware attacks, exemplified by incidents affecting school districts and government entities like the Bay Shore and Lindenhurst school districts, underscores the urgent need for bolstered cybersecurity measures in critical sectors. Collaborative efforts involving agencies like CISA and the Secret Service aim to strengthen defenses against cyber threats targeting schools, hospitals, and local governments. By disrupting cyber criminals' financial incentives and prioritizing cybersecurity as a national security imperative, government leaders are taking proactive steps to safeguard essential services and ensure the continuity of government operations in the face of evolving cyber threats."

 First, the Bureau has to meet the challenges of the first 
high-tech census by ensuring IT readiness and addressing the 
digital divide, cyber attacks, and disinformation campaigns.
    The Bureau must update Congress on the status of system 
readiness to build confidence at a time when many people are 
skeptical and even fearful of government and data security.
    Further, our coalition has observed intentional efforts to 
suppress census participation in social and traditional media. 
Under pressure from the Leadership Conference, other civil 
rights groups, and Congress, tech companies have started to 
fight disinformation and misinformation that is preying on 
people's fears.
    Both the Bureau and tech companies must be transparent 
about their plans to counter census interference and ensure 
that these policies are strictly enforced.


 We have to anticipate disinformation social media campaigns 
designed to mislead communities and communities of color about 
the census and sow seeds of fear about census participation.
    Community and outreach in education has been hampered by 
the failed citizenship question which heightened distrust and 
fear of the census in immigrant communities.


 Mr. Morial, one of the areas that I think that is key is if 
there is false information that is being put out there in 
predominantly urban areas that is not something that I have an 
expertise on.


 We want everyone counted, as the chairman said in her 
opening statement, citizen and noncitizen. The Constitution 
requires it and fairness demands it.
    So, I just want to give you an opportunity. I mean, is this 
some conspiracy by one of the two political parties to avoid 
getting data on what otherwise ought to be a simple analytical 
tool--a question about your citizenship status?
    Mr. Yang. Thank you, Mr. Connolly, for that question and I 
must say that I am proud to be a constituent of your 
jurisdiction.
    Mr. Connolly. God bless you.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Yang. This goes to what Mr. Vargas was saying. Let me 
correct the record first with respect to the citizenship 
question.
    It is incorrect to say that the citizenship question has 
appeared on every decennial census for 200 years.


 This trust challenge is a difficult one in an age of social 
media-drive conspiracy theories and Russia propaganda campaigns 
to sow distrust among Americans in our society and just the 
background levels of paranoia about government and politics.
    So, that places an extra burden on government not only to 
act with complete integrity and transparency but also to bring 
a positive message about democratic government and 
constitutionally established practices like the census to the 
people.


  Gun owners are always under attack. I think about a year 
ago the Knights of Columbus were under attack. We always have 
the ongoing conflict between taxpayers and tax takers.
    But I think when we set up so many groups like this it 
creates a false narrative that we have going on in America is 
disagreement by racial background. I disagree with that.
    But thinking about that, over time I think, due to 
intermarriage, we are going to have--it is going to become more 
apparent that there is less and less of that sort of conflict 
here and I am going to ask you folks when I fill out the census 
form or when somebody else fills out the census form how 
exactly they should fill it out when you have a mixed 
background.


So, I am very concerned about something that I believe you 
referenced in your testimony, at least in your written 
testimony, which is the potential for census-related 
disinformation efforts.
    We talked about the importance of getting good education 
and information out there and why we need to lean on that as 
strongly as we possibly can.
    But we also have to combat disinformation when it comes to 
the census process.
    Could you discuss what census-related disinformation could 
look like, how it can be spread, and what the negative effects 
of it might be?
    Ms. Gupta. Thank you, Congressman, and thank you for your 
leadership on so many of these issues.
    So, we have been deeply concerned about census-related 
disinformation, which really seeks to persuade masses of people 
to kind of not participate in the count and disinformation is 
usually pushed by bad actors with trying to propagate false 
information to make that viral to scare people away from 
participating and it can contain false information about who 
can participate, about when to participate, about how to 
participate, and it can spread through social media and 
networks.
    The negative effect can be, literally, that countless 
people count themselves out, meaning that they do not fill out 
the census as a result and they will then, therefore, miss out 
on Federal representation, on being represented in state 
districts and on the--you know, being counted for purposes of 
schools and hospitals and health care and the like.
	 We have been--many of our groups have been very actively 
working with social media companies around ensuring that they 
have as--that they are developing policies to prevent census 
interference right now and I can--I can say more about that.
    Mr. Sarbanes. Yes, let me ask you about that because I 
gather that last month Facebook announced a new policy on 
census interference on its platform--disinformation being 
spread on its platform and said it is not going to allow those 
kinds of misleading posts that would reduce census 
participation.


 Facebook announced that they will--that any content that 
violates their census interference policy will be allowed--will 
not be allowed to remain on the platforms as newsworthy, even 
if it is posted by a politician and that was a pretty 
significant step for the company.
    They have created an enforcement kind of protocol and we 
want to make sure, though, that they are going to continue to 
engage with stakeholders in meaningful ways such as hosting an 
external census working group to complement their internal 
efforts and we have asked the company to share information that 
they are getting about the targets of particular disinformation 
campaigns so that the Bureau--the Census Bureau and our 
organizations can then come in and flood the zone with the 
accurate information to make sure nobody is lost as a result.


Mr. Cloud. There has been a lot of talk about 
disinformation and, Mr. Vargas, you said something that 
troubled me.
    You characterized the administration as being anti-
immigrant, having a campaign against immigrants. And I think 
part of this information--disinformation has--you know, we 
cannot be conflating the vital need to secure the border and to 
mitigate what the cartels are doing in our Nation and 
communities like mine against an immigration policy.
    Because the truth is--and I ask to submit this for the 
record: the Hill article ``Deportations Lower Under Trump 
Administration Than Obama,'' and the truth is they were lower 
under Bush than Clinton. And so if we could stop the rhetoric I 
think it would go really far to dissuading the fear that we see 
often.


So, and we will say this. I think all of us, our 
experiences with the Census Bureau staff, the line level 
people, they take that protection seriously and that is part of 
what Mr. Vargas has talked about in terms of the Census Bureau 
being a trusted messenger of sorts that we rely on.
    So, those protections are absolutely in place and that is 
something we do need to emphasize to our community and protect 
from any misinformation with respect to that.


 Mr. Vargas. Some are, and in fact they have hired some very 
excellent partnership specialists across the country that we 
have had the opportunity to work with.
    But there also have been other partnerships with 
specialists that in our opinion have been not well deployed in 
the sense that they don't have the skill sets, the language to 
work in the community where they are being deployed by the 
Census Bureau, and in other cases because of the timing and the 
rush to hire enough people they are not adequately trained. And 
so they are misinformed about the full range of the census 
operation.",Addressing Challenges and Disinformation in the Census,"The text discusses the challenges the Census Bureau faces in conducting the first high-tech census, including IT readiness, the digital divide, cyber attacks, and disinformation campaigns.

While the information our intelligence community has on 
some of these foreign groups is admittedly less than we would 
like, the intelligence community has assessed that domestic 
racially and ethnically motivated violent extremist groups, 
which advocate for the superiority of the White race, have, 
``the most persistent and concerning transnational 
connections'' of all U.S. domestic violent extremists.
    Through these connections, they spread propaganda, train, 
and attempt to collaborate in carrying out violent acts. Given 
their relative ease of travel and communication, labeling these 
groups, their leaders, and their supporters as what they are is 
one of--is all the more important to curb the threat at home 
and abroad.


 For example, the Proud Boys, which has had a number of its 
members indicted on conspiracy charges around January 6, has 
spawned local chapters, not just in the United States, but in 
Britain, Norway, and Australia. Canada is so concerned about 
the Proud Boys that they have made the decision to list them as 
a foreign terrorist organization, along with The Base and the 
Atomwaffen Division. This is something we will need to discuss 
here today.
    I spent a significant amount of time examining the 
connections between terrorists and their networks in the Middle 
East in my prior life, before running for Congress, and I have 
been surprised by the vast amount of publicly-available 
information that demonstrates the international connections of 
some of these U.S.-based extremist groups, especially ones 
promoting a White supremacist ideology.
    We can see for ourselves that these domestic groups are 
generating, and, in many cases, exporting a unique brand of 
terrorism. They are learning lessons from plots, propaganda, 
and attacks that are similarly driven by hate and violence 
abroad.


Our focus today is on the connections between individuals and 
groups here in the United States, who use violence to further their 
racially or ethnically driven political goals; and the growing number 
of foreign groups who share their aims, ideologies, and violent 
designs. While the information our intelligence community has on some 
of these foreign groups is admittedly less than we'd like, the IC has 
assessed that domestic racially and ethnically motivated violent 
extremist groups which advocate for the superiority of the White race 
have ``the most persistent and concerning transnational connections'' 
of all U.S. domestic violent extremists.
    Through these connections, they spread propaganda, train, and 
attempt to collaborate in carrying out violent acts. Given their 
relative ease of travel and communication, labeling these groups, their 
leaders, and their supporters as what they are is all the more 
important to curb this threat at home and abroad.
    That said, it remains true that foreign groups with transnational 
ties span a broad range of ideologies, including everyone from White 
supremacists and radical Islamic terrorists. This isn't a new or 
unfamiliar threat: It's one we've confronted in various forms, for 
decades. But over the past few years, the United States and countries 
around the world have seen a surge in violence and terrorism 
perpetrated by these kinds of organizations. This isn't just an 
American threat, it's a global one.


 My colleagues here this morning were also with me on January 6, as 
we experienced a firsthand manifestation of the threat we are going to 
talk about today. We all saw the havoc domestic terrorists and other 
rioters caused as they tried to upend our democratic process, and we 
mourn the loss of life that resulted. As the dust settles from that 
attack--and hundreds of the insurrectionists have been charged with an 
assortment of crimes--we are beginning to see connections between some 
of the more organized groups connected to that attack, and sympathetic 
groups that have taken root in parts of Europe, Australia, and 
elsewhere. For example, The Proud Boys, which has had a number of its 
members indicted on conspiracy charges around January 6, has spawned 
local chapters not just across the United States but also in Britain, 
Norway, and Australia. Canada is so concerned that they have made the 
decision to list the Proud Boys, as well as The Base and the Atomwaffen 
Division, as foreign terrorist organizations. That is something we will 
need to discuss here today.
    I spent a significant amount of my career examining the connections 
between terrorists and their networks in the Middle East, and I've been 
surprised by the vast amount of publicly available information that 
demonstrates the international connections of some of these U.S.-based 
violent extremist groups, especially ones promoting a White supremacist 
ideology. We can see for ourselves that these domestic groups are 
generating--and, in many cases, are exporting--a unique brand of 
terrorism. And, they're learning lessons from plots, propaganda, and 
attacks that are similarly driven by hate and violence abroad.


 But, as an American society, as a culture, and for somebody 
who has spent my career fighting against all sorts of the 
threats around the globe, you know, I think we should look at 
our system of justice and the law enforcement agents and those 
who are studying this on a daily basis and say, you know, there 
is a bright side to this, that the organization, and from my 
conversations with our witnesses today, it seems to be a lone-
wolf type of a threat instead of a very organized threat that 
we see in some of the foreign terrorist organizations, like al-
Qaeda, like ISIS, and others that have organized to the point 
where they are affecting society as a whole. So, let's dig into 
that, and let's not be afraid to look at those facts.
    It is on points like these that I look forward to working 
with Chair Slotkin, and other Members of the subcommittee, to 
address the variety of challenges that we are facing. The 
threat landscape today is vast. It is far and wide, whether we 
are dealing with cyber attacks from China, ISIS; whether it is 
in Syria or terrorism, domestic terrorism here on American 
soil, there is a lot of work to be done.


  The threat landscape today stretches far and wide--whether we are 
dealing with a cyber attack from China, ISIS in Syria, or terrorism 
here on American soil. There is a lot of work to be done. We look 
forward to working with our Executive branch partners to continue to 
combat the threat of terrorism both internationally and domestically. I 
look forward to hearing more about how we can support and further these 
efforts in relation to RMVE from an agency perspective.


 A brief note on terminology. The State Department uses the 
term ``RMVE'' for attacks perpetrated by individuals and groups 
aiming to advance a political agenda to defend against what 
they perceive as threats to their racial or ethnic identity. 
RMVE individuals and groups often violently target members of 
religious, racial, or ethnic minority groups, immigrants, 
LGBTQI+ persons, and governments.
    Today's digital platforms connect RMVE individuals and 
groups to a broad range of conspiracy theories, misinformation 
and disinformation, and violent extremist ideologies, fueling a 
perverse fear of a so-called White genocide and other 
exclusionary narratives and stoking calls to action.


 To effectively tackle the threat posed by REMVE actors, we need to 
understand the motivations and ideologies that fuel the horrific crimes 
they commit. The on-going misuse of today's digital platforms can 
connect REMVE individuals and groups to a broad range of conspiracy 
theories, mis- and disinformation, and violent extremist ideologies, 
many of which may be protected speech under the First Amendment. While 
these informal on-line communities make it difficult to encapsulate one 
overarching REMVE narrative, REMVE ideologies often encompass anti-
Semitism, drawing extensively from Nazi-era propaganda. REMVE actors 
are frequently influenced by works of hate and paranoia that provide an 
ideological framework for their violent actions. These narratives fuel 
a call to action by fomenting a perverse fear of ``White genocide,'' 
and feed into other exclusionary narratives globally.


 For many of those who have conducted attacks, or have been 
disrupted and prevented from conducting attacks, their 
connection with these ideological beliefs comes through the 
consumption of racist, violent extremist, terrorism-related 
materials and conspiracy theories that they find on-line 
through social media and other on-line platforms.
    Further complicating the threat environment is that our 
adversaries, whether they be foreign nation-states, 
international extremist thought leaders, or even foreign 
terrorist groups like al-Qaeda in the Islamic State, they 
understand this, and they have devoted themselves toward 
understanding and leveraging the fractures in our society, so 
that they can also disseminate extremist rhetoric, and other 
false narratives in an effort to incite violence and sow 
discord.


 DVE is typically fueled by violent extremist rhetoric and other 
grievances, including false narratives and conspiracy theories, often 
spread through social media and other on-line platforms by a broad 
range of domestic actors, and occasionally amplified by foreign threat 
actors, such as foreign nation-states or FTOs. DVEs exploit a variety 
of popular social media platforms, smaller websites with targeted 
audiences, and encrypted chat applications to recruit new adherents, 
plan and rally support for in-person actions, and disseminate materials 
that contribute to radicalization and mobilization to violence.


 In many cases, these RMVEs are inspired by violent extremist 
narratives or conspiracy theories that are spread on-line by U.S.-based 
ideologues, movements, and other individuals, and occasionally by a 
variety of foreign adversaries. Identifying those involved in 
destructive, violent, and threat-related behavior is a complex 
challenge. For example, DVEs may filter or disguise on-line 
communications with vague innuendo or coded language to protect 
operational security, avoid violating social media platforms' terms of 
service, and appeal to a broader pool of potential recruits. Under the 
guise of First Amendment-protected activity, DVEs can recruit 
supporters, and incite and engage in violence. Further complicating the 
challenge, these groups often migrate to private or closed social media 
platforms and encrypted channels to obfuscate their activity.


  Mr. Cohen. It is highly significant, because what you 
described is one element of a broader effort by foreign hostile 
powers to undermine credibility of the U.S. Government by 
sowing discord amongst our populous for the purposes of 
destabilizing our country, undermining our relationships with 
our key allies through the use of disinformation and other 
narratives that are intended to exacerbate the problems within 
the United States, so it is part of a broader effort.


 Bilaterally, we work with a number of partners on things 
like information sharing to ensure that we are sharing a common 
picture of the threat. That is particularly important with 
partners and allies who frankly may be questioning the 
credibility of the United States as a partner and ally in light 
of the disconcerting and persistent and aggressive kinds of 
disinformation campaigns that Assistant Secretary Cohen 
referred to.


 Mr. Godfrey, the mission of the State Department's Global 
Engagement Center is to counter foreign state and non-state 
propaganda in disinformation efforts. Given their efforts to 
understand how narratives and counter-narratives work in 
societies, and to work with the tech sector to develop tools 
and methods to fight false narratives, what is the role of the 
GEC, the Global Engagement Center, in State Department efforts 
against racially and ethnically motivated violent extremist 
groups?
    Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Congressman. You are right that the 
Global Engagement Center has, exactly as you said, the mandates 
to both track and also counter state and non-state 
disinformation efforts. That is something that initially came 
out of, as you know, the focus on Islamist terrorists, al-
Qaeda, ISIS, and the like. But certainly, it encompasses, as 
all of our counterterrorism tools here at the Department of 
State do, all brands, or types of terrorism, so those tools are 
ideologically neutral and they get applied in that way.
	 I think one of the things that is vitally important that 
both the GEC and the Bureau of Counterterrorism do, often in 
tandem, is to engage the tech sector directly on the nature of 
these threats, and we do that for a couple of purposes. One is 
to ensure, particularly for smaller platform providers that may 
lack the resources of some of the larger tech companies that 
have big Government services offices, to ensure awareness of 
what the threat is, what it looks like, and the specific ways 
in which some of these actors are exploiting platforms for 
malign purposes.


  I share your concern. Police officers, members of the 
military are susceptible to being influenced by on-line 
conspiracy theories and narratives like anybody else. It is 
important--and I know I have spoken with a number of police 
chiefs, and one of the issues that we are focused on within the 
Department and the Federal Government broadly is to ensure that 
we have an understanding of whether those narratives are 
influencing not only the beliefs, but the behavior of the men 
and women who either serve in the military or in law 
enforcement.


 Now, I guess, getting back to some of our panelists here 
today, we have that distinction or that--I guess, I would love 
to dig a little bit more deeper into the balance of what we 
have seen from propaganda, or misinformation, that has been 
amplified by foreign governments, especially malign foreign 
governments, with an intent toward the recruitment, or the 
populating of that misinformation ecosphere for domestic 
consumption, versus where have foreign governments--I guess 
here is the question: Have we seen foreign governments that 
have been actively using organizations that could potentially 
be designated FTOs? Have we seen foreign governments actively 
using them in order to recruit or bolster membership 
domestically?
    I guess more likely for Mr. Cohen.
    Mr. Cohen. Congressman, thank you for the question.
    That is probably an issue we would have to discuss in a 
closed session, to address it completely.",Canada Designates Proud Boys and Similar Groups as Foreign Terrorist Organizations,"Canada has designated The Proud Boys, along with other groups like The Base and the Atomwaffen Division, as foreign terrorist organizations due to concerns over their activities and potential threats. This decision underscores growing international recognition of these groups' transnational connections and activities."
117,H085,"H085


 We are facing an unprecedented situation in which political 
leaders, up to and including a former President, have been 
actively promoting corrosive anti-democratic messages that 
circulate paranoia, cynicism, and violence. This cesspool of 
conspiracy thinking is activating unstable individuals 
predisposed, because of a mixture of ideological grievances and 
personal disappointments, to commit violence. This is a problem 
that demands the attention of all of us and, indeed, everyone 
in the country who believes in the constitutional order.


 This is a trend that began several years ago and has 
continued to evolve. And while, as we look back at past 
attacks, the specific motives behind these attacks vary, 
analysis and research tells us that many of the attackers share 
common behavioral characteristics. In particular, these are 
people who tend to be angry, socially disconnected, seeking a 
sense of life meaning. They spend significant time online, and 
ultimately self-connect with a cause or grievance to justify 
the use of violence as a way to express their anger and achieve 
a sense of social connection and self-worth.
    It is a threat that does not often fit into traditional 
terrorism-or extremism-related definitional categories. In 
fact, this is one of the primary challenges in trying to define 
and investigate these types of threats. Those who engage in 
violence often self-connect with a combination of extremist 
beliefs or a blend of extremist beliefs and personal 
grievances. Terms of art like ``salad bar extremism'' and 
``hybrid ideologies'' are references to the fact that attackers 
adapt a blend of ideological beliefs and grievances.
    This is a threat that manifests itself both in the physical 
and digital environments. Online content, disinformation, false 
narratives, and conspiracy theories spread by foreign nation-
states, international terrorist groups, and extremist thought 
leaders fuel much of the violence we are experiencing in the 
country today. Domestic and foreign threat actors purposely 
seek to exploit the fractures in our society, the anger and 
discord in our political discourse to sow discord and inspire 
acts of violence.


 The threat posed by high-risk individuals who do not meet 
the investigative threshold necessary for terrorism-related 
investigations. This means providing grant funding, training, 
technical assistance to local communities so that law 
enforcement, mental health professionals, social service 
providers, educators, and community groups can work together to 
identify those individuals who are traveling down the path of 
violence and develop strategies to manage those folks.
    Let me close by saying real quickly that we recognize that 
we are facing a broad, complex, and diverse threat environment. 
We're dealing with an evolving foreign terrorism threat. We're 
dealing with a multiyear trend of increased violent crime. 
We're dealing with disinformation and other covert actions by 
foreign intelligence services. We're dealing with a broad range 
of cyberthreats. We need, at the Department, to be able to deal 
with all of those threats effectively as well as the threat 
posed by domestic terrorists, violent extremists, and targeted 
violence. Let me also say finally that it is not our job to 
police thought. It is not our job to infringe on the 
constitutional rights of Americans. It is our job to prevent 
violence, and the men and women of DHS work closely with law 
enforcement across the country to do that.


 Mr. Raskin. I want to thank all of the witnesses for their 
excellent testimony today, and I will recognize myself for my 
five minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Wiegmann, let me start with you, picking up on that 
last point. It seems to me that we have a very difficult 
problem because so much of the domestic violent extremist 
activity that takes place is motivated, and inspired, and 
incited by speech online. So what does it mean to say that the 
government wants to disrupt and deter domestic terror activity 
when that activity, as Mr. Cohen testifies, often arises from 
lone actors, individuals who get inspired by disinformation and 
propaganda that they read online?
    Mr. Wiegmann. Yes, and thank you for that question. If your 
question is--what are the rules that we have around online 
activity and how we investigate that? Is that your question?
    Mr. Raskin. Yes.
    Mr. Wiegmann. Yes. So, again, as I mentioned in my opening 
statement, we cannot collect information solely on the basis of 
hate speech or First Amendment protected activity. So if 
someone is online saying they hate a particular religious group 
or ethnic group, that in and of itself is not enough to 
initiate investigative activity, but if it is coupled with any 
kind of indications of violence, that would be something that 
we could investigate. We have a whole set of detailed rules, 
both in the Attorney General guidelines that were developed in 
the 1970's in response to the abuses from the 60's and 70's 
that were identified in the Church Committee Report, and then 
the FBI has an extensive manual, which I actually brought with 
me today. It's called the Domestic Investigations and 
Operations Guide. I don't know if you all can see that on the 
video, but it is a very thick, kind of the size of a phone 
book, set of rules that we have for the different phases of an 
investigation, when you can initiate an investigation, and it 
talks about the First Amendment constraints. It talks about 
freedom of association. It talks about freedom of speech, 
freedom of religion. And the FBI has lawyers that are actively 
involved in all investigations, but, in particular, in domestic 
terrorism investigations, to ensure that will that we are 
walking that line.


 Mr. Raskin. I appreciate that. And then I wanted to ask you 
a final substantive question, which is, I guess all of you 
witnesses have remarked upon the linkage between disinformation 
and propaganda and the incitement of terrorist activity and 
violence. And I am just wondering if you would speak to the 
problem of mainstream political leaders, or leaders identified 
with the mainstream of American political culture, trafficking 
in disinformation or propaganda that gives aid and support to 
the movements of violent white supremacy.
    Mr. Cohen. Mr. Chairman, that is an important question, and 
if you will indulge me for a moment I would like to place my 
answer into context. As I look at the threat environment after 
spending over 35 years working in this field, I equate it to a 
perfect storm. On the one hand, we are a Nation that has become 
deeply divided, polarized. People tend to view those who hold 
opposing opinions to their own as the enemy. We have far too 
people who are angry about their plight in life or angry about 
how they view the state of the Nation, and we have far too many 
people in this country who view violence as a legitimate way in 
which to express that anger. The fractures in our country run 
deep, whether it is on immigration, our response to COVID, 
issues of race, the role of government, the integrity of our 
election process, and credibility in our government. These are 
issues that our Nation is deeply divided about.
	 Our adversaries know this, and they seek to exploit those 
fractures in our society by spreading false narratives, 
conspiracy theories, disinformation in an effort to sow 
discord, inspire acts of violence, undermine confidence in our 
government structure, weaken our relationship with our friends 
and allies abroad, and destabilize our Nation. So when public 
figures, and this is really important because these narratives 
are typically introduced on discreet, small platforms, whether 
it is by a foreign intelligence service, an international 
terrorist group, or domestic terror organization. They will 
introduce these narratives onto small platforms in discreet 
discrete communities in the hopes that they will be amplified 
and eventually introduced into the mainstream ecosystem.
    So when public figures, whether they be in the media, or 
they are elected officials, or former elected officials, 
amplify and spread those narratives, they validate them. And 
when they validate them, they increase the potential that an 
individual who is vulnerable to being influenced, vulnerable to 
being influenced to commit an act of violence, will see this as 
a legitimate rationale for committing an act of violence. So in 
a sense, when these disinformation narratives are amplified by 
public figures, it not only supports our adversaries, but it 
brings more volatility to the threat environment.
	 Mr. Raskin. I appreciate very much the lucidity of your 
response there. I assume there is not too much that you as law 
enforcement officials can do about that, but you are at least 
blowing the whistle on a really important and disturbing trend. 
If I am reading you correctly, we do have foreign adversaries 
who try to exploit political and social fractures in our 
country by injecting disinformation and propaganda that then 
can be picked up, and further deepen and exacerbate those 
conflicts. I appreciate that. And I don't know, Ms. Mace, if 
you had any final questions you wanted to ask?",The Intersection of Disinformation and Domestic Terrorism,"The testimony before the committee highlighted the complex and concerning intersection of disinformation, extremism, and domestic terrorism. Witnesses emphasized the role of online platforms in radicalizing individuals and inciting violence, often through the spread of false narratives and conspiracy theories. There was a notable discussion on the challenges law enforcement faces in addressing domestic extremism while respecting First Amendment protections. Additionally, the witnesses pointed out the detrimental impact of mainstream political leaders amplifying disinformation, which validates extremist narratives and further destabilizes societal divisions. The testimony underscored the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to combat disinformation and address the root causes of domestic terrorism."

 \1\ The prepared statement of Senator Johnson appears in the 
Appendix on page 45.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I will just keep my comments brief.
    This hearing really came about after I sat down with 
Director Krebs a couple weeks ago, and the point the Director 
is making to me--and I do not want to steal all of his thunder 
is--95 percent of ransomware and so many cyberattacks can be 
prevented, with just basic cyber hygiene. So I want to really 
talk about that.
    So the bottom line and the purpose of this hearing is to--
because I have always said the first line of defense in any 
kind of cybersecurity issues is public awareness, understanding 
what is out there, the sharing of threat information, which is 
a key role of Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency 
(CISA).
    But, again, having read all the testimony, this ought to be 
pretty good. We have the Federal. We have State and local here, 
but we have with Ms. Crawford, a pretty relevant example of 
what happens when an attack occurs within a State under 
multiple jurisdictions. And what happened, kind of going 
through that case study, I think it would be extremely 
effective. To me, it seemed like a pretty good success story 
when all is said and done based on really what could have 
happened and how long those industries could have been shut 
down.
    So, again, just really looking to raise the profile for the 
public in terms of how serious these cyberattacks are, how 
pervasive they are, and just basic things you can do to protect 
yourself, and that is the main purpose of the hearing.
    So, with that, I will turn it over to Senator Peters.


  \1\ The prepared statement of Senator Peters appear in Appendix on 
page 46.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I am especially pleased that we have Chris DeRusha with us 
here today. He is the Chief Security Officer for the State of 
Michigan and an important partner in combating cyberattacks in 
my home State.
    Chris, I also want to congratulate you on welcoming a baby 
boy last month--actually 2 weeks, 2 weeks old now?
    Mr. DeRusha. That is right. About 2\1/2\ weeks.
    Senator Peters. Two and a half weeks and----
    Chairman Johnson. He looks well rested.
    Mr. DeRusha. We are still counting days.
    Senator Peters. Still counting days.
    As I mentioned to him in the back room, we were happy to 
give him a night last night so he could sleep the entire night 
when he came here to Washington. But thank you for coming and 
appreciate your wife allowing you to be here with us here 
today.
    The cyber threats facing our Nation are becoming 
increasingly sophisticated and we are all at risk--families, 
government agencies, schools, small businesses, and critical 
infrastructure.
    In today's digital world, State and local governments are 
responsible for safeguarding everything from election systems 
to very sensitive personal data, including Social Security 
numbers, credit card information, and of course, medical 
records.
    State and local governments do not always have the tools, 
unfortunately, to defend against cyberattacks. Financial 
constraints, workforce challenges, and outdated equipment, I 
know are all serious challenges for States and cities.
    Attackers always look for the weakest link, and that is why 
we must ensure that everyone from small businesses to our State 
and local governments have the tools that they need to prevent, 
detect, and to respond to cyberattacks.
    That is why I introduced common sense, bipartisan 
legislation with my colleagues on this Committee to help 
bolster our cybersecurity defenses at all levels of government.
    I introduced the bipartisan DOTGOV Act with Chairman 
Johnson and Senator Lankford to help State and local 
governments transition to a more trusted and secure dot-gov 
domain.
    I also introduced the State and Local Government 
Cybersecurity Act with Senator Portman. This will help the 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) share timely information, 
deliver training and resources, and provide technical 
assistance on cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities, and 
breaches in States and localities.


 Just yesterday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted 
Chinese actors for the Equifax hack. Earlier in the year, 
increased tensions with Iran led to headlines of imminent 
cyberattacks on all manner of our Nation's infrastructure, and 
then there is Russia, Russia's efforts to interfere with our 
elections and target energy systems.


 And, six, expanding event notification from Multi-State 
Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC). MS-ISAC is a 
valuable partner for Texas' cybersecurity program. Frequently, 
however, MS-ISAC will not inform us at DIR when an incident has 
occurred at a Texas local government entity. This puts the 
State and local governments at a disadvantage from a response 
recovery or prevention perspective. Old news or partial news 
does not equip State and local governments for responding 
effectively to these cyberattacks.


 Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Mr. DeRusha.
    I am going to start today. Normally, I kind of defer, but I 
want to kind of set the tone a little bit.
    When I first got here in 2011, that was really when we 
started seeing some of these big cyberattacks. I cannot 
remember the exact timing, but when I got here, everybody said 
we got to do something about cybersecurity.
    So when I was sitting over there on the Committee, I would 
always ask the question: What are the top few things we need to 
do?
    It was always very consistent. The first thing was 
information sharing, which I think we have come a long ways 
toward achieving. It is far from perfect, but I think DHS has 
been recognized as sort of the hub in Federal Government to do 
it. The other one was a data breach notice, some kind of 
national preemptive policy.


  Dr. Krebs, you mentioned in your opening comments, the list 
of foreign actors that are very sophisticated, that have been 
attacking us, including the Chinese attack on Equifax. 
Certainly, we are worrying about the election, potential 
interference again from the Russians.
    But we just had a major incident that heightened 
everybody's awareness, and that was after the Iranian attack. 
There was a very higher threat level associated with, perhaps, 
Iranian retaliatory cyberattacks.
    So can you give me an assessment of how the reaction--
looking back now in an after-action? Because we went through 
that. Luckily, nothing happened, to our knowledge, but is there 
a gap that we need to be aware of in terms of our response from 
the Federal level and there is a way for this Committee to help 
you fill that gap?
    Mr. Krebs. So the way I see it, the Department of Homeland 
Security in 2003 was established to do two things, at least my 
part of the organization, bring people together quickly and 
share information rapidly.


 So if both of you can just touch on--I will start with you, 
Ms. Crawford. What kind of training exercise and resiliency 
plans would have helped cities and counties in Texas better 
prevent and respond to cyberattacks like the one you saw in 
August?
    Ms. Crawford. I think really, again, going back to the 
theme of awareness and education.


ough the system.
    I want to talk for a second about hiring authorities. That 
is one that we have not gotten into much today. Actually, I am 
sitting next to Tom Carper who worked on this way back in the 
2014 time period. We did pass legislation to help to provide 
you with additional hiring authority, ``exceptional hiring 
authority,'' as it was called. My sense is that that is still 
not enough, that you are still having a difficult time 
attracting to government the kind of cybersecurity expertise 
that you need. By the way, the same is true in the private 
sector. What more can we do there? What more can we give you in 
terms of authorities to be able to ensure you have the right 
people in place at the right time to respond to these 
increasing cyberattacks?
    Mr. Krebs. So I think stepping back a little bit, first 
off, whether it is the Boots on the Ground Act or the ability 
to direct higher authority for certain positions, I think those 
are paving the way for us to be more successful.
    I think we have some internal housekeeping to do in terms 
of the process from left to right, the entire hiring process. 
We have some internal roadblocks that we are working through 
right now that I am confident in the next 6 months, we will be 
able to make significant progress.


  Mr. DeRusha. So I think we find travel communities in very 
small municipalities similar challenges. There is really not 
even an awareness really of what cybersecurity is and what they 
should be doing. So we like to talk about thinking about these 
things in business risk, for mission risk. Cyberattacks can 
prevent them from delivering whatever services they deliver or 
just having normal operations and sort of helping them 
understand that there is a risk to them, and they do not need 
to necessarily have something of value. They could be just a 
target of opportunity.


 So one way to mitigate the impacts of cyberattacks on 
businesses is through the development of a comprehensive 
disaster recovery plan that will restore data, applications, 
even maybe save the hardware. And we know that such planning 
can help avoid the worst consequences of cyberattack.


 Senator Rosen. I have a second question. Of course, in my 
home State of Nevada, over 250,000 Nevada residents live in 
rural areas, and of course, in Las Vegas, where we have lots of 
active chamber and bigger State and local government presence 
there, my smaller communities do not have that. So how can we 
again share--maybe you can speak about this. Especially in 
Michigan, lots of rural communities. You have the upper 
peninsula up there going on. How do we help them get the 
qualified staff or the qualified training to combat these 
cyberattacks?
    Mr. DeRusha. So, Senator, we think about this, both on the 
prepare and the response side of the equation.
    From the preparedness side, it is a lot about developing 
communities of practice, advertising, making sure that they 
know they have State and Federal resources available to them, 
bringing these communities together so that they can do self-
help and help each other and start to get to know one another.


 Senator Carper. OK. Thank you. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    Let us go to Iran for just a little bit, if we could. Prior 
to our entering into the joint agreement between five countries 
and Iran on an effort to halt their nuclear weapon program. 
Prior to that, they were attacking our financial institutions 
using the internet, cyber attacks, unrelentingly. Within weeks 
following the signing of that agreement, those attacks dwindled 
significantly.
	 That reminded me at the time of root causes. The Chairman 
and I are two big proponents of not just addressing the 
symptoms of problems, but also the root causes of problems. 
That experience said to us maybe if we want Iran to back off, 
maybe having that kind of agreement and reward them for backing 
off would actually work.
    I want to go from that timeframe from roughly 5 years ago 
to today and ask this question. It appears there is broad 
consensus, Mr. Krebs, among national security officials, 
including yourself, that Iran, far from being finished with 
retaliation from this attack that we took to take out 
Soleimani, but they are likely to pursue cyberattacks on U.S. 
targets, including State, local, and tribal governments. They 
might hit the pause button for a while but eventually come 
after us again.
    What is more, we have known for sometime now that they are 
capable of doing a fair amount of damage through cyberattacks.
	 I believe, Mr. Krebs, you mentioned, I think, before I got 
here--I think you mentioned your interagency coordination after 
the strike on Soleimani, which is good. However, did the 
administration provide any warning to DHS, either through the 
Office of Intelligence and Analysis or to CISA specifically 
regarding an increased likelihood of cyberattack from Iran 
prior to carrying out the Soleimani strike?
    Mr. Krebs. So we have been operating at an enhanced alert 
posture since probably early last summer. June 22, I issued an 
advisory that seemed to indicate there was an increase in 
activity, spear-phishing, credentials stuffing, password 
spraying, those sorts of account compromise technique that the 
Iranians used. We had seen that over the course of the last 
couple months. So we had been already on heightened alert, and 
internal to the Department, we had a contingency plan for just 
this sort of thing.


 The second piece, as Chris just mentioned, is there is an 
aspect of countering disinformation baked in here as well. What 
we are encouraging organizations right now to do and 
individuals to do is go to your trusted sources for 
information. Do not just listen to the random dot-com or dot-
org or whatever. Go to the trusted source; election officials, 
for instance. Go to the election official's website to find out 
registration information, where you are supposed to go vote. 
That should be a dot-gov. We need to shore up the dot-gov 
registration process to make sure people do not get there and 
have unauthorized access to dot-govs, but assuming we get 
there, this will help counter a lot of particularly election 
disinformation as well.


 You have heard me kind of lay out my definition in terms of 
what you have to worry about. Vote tallies, voter files, and 
then the whole social media disinformation. Can you just kind 
of go through the vulnerability of those three? Voter tallies. 
What is our vulnerability there? What is the likelihood?
    Again, I know some voting machines have Wi-Fi, but it 
should not be hooked up during the voting. That should be very 
limited use. Then voter files which personally, I think, when 
it comes to CISA is your primary area of concern, certainly my 
area of concern, and then social media disinformation, the 
burden falls there on consumers. We need to be discerning 
consumers of information and how we use it, but can you just 
kind of go through those three?
    Mr. Krebs. I want to approach this maybe from a different 
perspective, but we have done a significant amount of research 
lately in the last year or so working a risk assessment across 
the system of systems that makes up election security. And what 
we found was the greatest opportunity for impact at scale. It 
is where things are highly centralized and highly networked, 
and to your point of the voter files, the voter registration 
data bases, that is precisely where if you wanted to create 
havoc at scale, catastrophically, that is where the adversary 
would hit.
	  On the voter tallies, I interpret that as the voting 
machines that are not necessarily networked. They are highly 
decentralized. So to get an effect at scale is going to be 
really difficult, particularly in an undetected way.
    This lays then into your third piece of voter 
disinformation. You have to question the strategic objectives 
of the adversary. The adversary may not be looking to achieve 
an outcome at scale and in an undetected manner. The outcome 
may be that they want to be detected in one key district in a 
swing State and throw the entire thing into question.

on page 160.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Cyberattacks are clearly one of the greatest threats to our 
national security, and as the Commission found in your report, 
the United States is not thoroughly prepared to defend itself 
in cyberspace. The findings and recommendations included in 
your report could not come at a more important time. 
Adversaries like China, Russia, and Iran have repeatedly 
attempted to hack into our critical infrastructure, interfere 
in our democratic process, and engage in large-scale 
intellectual property theft.
    Most recently, the Chinese government launched a 
cyberattack against our hospitals and health care research 
facilities in an effort to steal information on the coronavirus 
vaccine, an attack that threatened the health and the safety of 
Americans. Every one of these attempted attacks are targeted to 
undermine our national and economic security, and without 
sufficient cybersecurity tools, resources, and skilled 
personnel, these attacks could have a devastating impact on our 
daily lives.
    Your report makes some critical recommendations that 
Congress must consider as we work to ensure that our country is 
better prepared to deter, to prevent, and to recover from 
malicious-style attacks. Your recommendations are very wide-
ranging, but I think they boil down to basically three main 
goals. One, we must work with our allies to promote responsible 
behavior in cyberspace, we must deny benefits to our 
adversaries who exploit our vulnerabilities, and we must impose 
greater costs on those who engage in malicious cyberattacks.
    I have been very proud to work on a bipartisan basis with 
many of my colleagues here on this Committee to advance 
legislation that will help meet some of these goals, and I look 
forward to discussing these recommendations today and finding 
some additional ways for us to come together and to make sure 
that we are dealing with cybersecurity issues.


Now the fundamental strategy, if you will, is called 
layered cyber defense, layered cyber deterrence, and here are 
the layers. No. 1 is shape behaviors. That is, establish norms 
and standards in the international community so that this is 
not a unilateral, one-country kind of effort.
    The second is to deny benefits, and that is to strengthen 
our cyber defense, and part of this is reorganization, part of 
this is strengthening CISA and other agencies that we will talk 
about later this morning. But to basically be more resilient, 
and that includes plans for the recovery of the economy, in the 
case of a cyberattack.


 And fifth and finally, we believe we need to strengthen our 
cyber supply chains. The Commission has taken an approach that 
believes in the power of free and fair competition to breed 
innovation, but our current strategy amounts to little more 
than occasionally limiting the access of firms that we do not 
trust into our markets. I believe this is not working, and 
consider the competition for 5G, where the Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) is able to subsidize their national champions, like 
Huawei, thereby advance their goal of dominating the global 
market without having to respond to market forces.
    To counter this, the Commission calls for investing 
information and communications technology (ICT), industrial 
capacity, and reinvigorating our investment in research and 
development (R&D). Of course, this will cost some money, but 
whether, in terms of responding to a pandemic or responding to 
a massive cyberattack, we believe that America can no longer 
afford to depend on the largesse of the Chinese Communist Party 
for critical technologies.

 We have a number of urgent election-related 
recommendations, but I would like to conclude this morning with 
our recommendations to build public resilience against 
disinformation. Media literacy can help, but we really need to 
focus on defeating a key objective of our adversary, which is 
to weaken democracy by pouring gasoline on the flames of 
division that already occupy online discourse, pushing 
Americans to give up on our institution, not just election but 
the justice system, the rule of law, and democracy. They seek 
to destroy the informed and engaged citizenry upon which our 
democracy depends.


  Every day American companies like Southern Company face 
millions of cyberattacks, including from nation-state 
adversaries. With the full support of the private sector, the 
Federal Government must advance a strategy to defend forward 
and maintain an offensive posture in cyberspace through 
regular, persistent engagement with friends and foes alike. 
This engagement must include the full weight of the Federal 
Government, including the Department of Defense (DOD), the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Secret Service, and 
the intelligence community (IC) to allow for rapid and 
effective responses to these attacks.
	The third strategic prong is to deny benefits to our enemy. 
We do this by strengthening the critical infrastructure's 
ability to maintain continuity against a cyberattack. We must 
also take steps to reshape the cyber ecosystem, the people, 
processes, and technology and data that make up cyberspace 
toward greater security.


 Chairman Johnson. As you well know, we are going to need a 
lot of help. I am not even sure we have our sails up, much less 
wind in them.
    Mr. Fanning, you and I have spoken in the past and met 
about my concern about, for example, electromagnetic pulse 
(EMP) and geomagnetic disturbance (GMD) as a threat to our 
national grid. Cyberattacks represent a similar type of threat. 
Can you give us some assurance that we are addressing these 
problems, that we have resiliency within our electrical grid? I 
mean, what progress has been made?
    And I am particularly concerned right now that Iran has 
launched, successfully, a satellite that is circling the globe 
and, coming up over America probably multiple times a day. That 
is a big concern of mine.


  Senator Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My first question 
is for Senator King and Mr. Fanning. News reports have recently 
indicated that the Chinese government has been sponsoring 
cyberattacks against our hospitals, our government networks, 
and our medical research institutions, presumably in search of 
COVID-19 vaccine research. This is clearly unacceptable. It 
puts Americans' lives at risk.
    So my first question to Senator King is how would some of 
the recommendations, specifically in this report of yours, 
enable us to combat these kinds of attacks that we are seeing 
from China?
    Senator King. Unfortunately I think it is important to note 
that China is a long-range problem in cyberspace. They are 
clearly active, they want to be more active, and they are 
coming at us. I think if you go back through our 
recommendations, No. 1, we need to step back and start talking 
about establishing international norms and standards so that if 
there is a violation it is not only us that are calling foul 
but it is the whole world. And I think that has to be part of 
the strategy for combating something like what China is doing.


 My next question is for Senator King as well. The 
Solarium's recommendations regarding the continuity of the 
economy I think are particularly relevant, given the challenges 
that we are addressing here with the coronavirus pandemic. So 
in the event of a widespread or a prolonged cyberattacks on 
critical infrastructure, I think we all agree that the impact 
could be catastrophic.
    So my question for you, Senator King is can you discuss the 
recommendation, and what lessons do you think we are learning 
from COVID-19 that you think we should be considering for a 
long-term cyberattack?
    Senator King. I think one of the first things we have 
learned is the necessity of planning, the necessity of thinking 
the unthinkable, of putting smart people into a room and 
talking about what could happen and what would happen, and how 
to bring the economy back. I think the continuity of the 
economy planning and setting that up as a real function is one 
of our most important recommendations. And we have to be 
thinking about what happens if the Northeast grid goes down, or 
the Southern grid. But we have to be thinking about the lessons 
that we are learning now, some unanticipated.


  Just reflect back on some of the steps that we have plugged 
in, including making it easier for the Department of Homeland 
Security to hire people that are needed. With the EINSTEIN, as 
you may recall, we really got a lot done to try to improve our 
ability to defend against cyberattacks. What did we do well, 
and one of the things we have tried to do was try to create a 
system, and we finally did in 2018. But what are some things 
that we did well, and what is the unfinished business please? 
Thank you.


 I just want to give you a chance to expand on some of those 
themes which I think are so important. So let me just ask you, 
start by asking when it comes to cyberattacks, what is it you 
see? How does China typically operate? How do they typically 
attack? Whom do they typically target? And what is it that they 
seek to gain or disrupt?
    Mr. Gallagher. Well, just quickly, my own awakening on this 
issue was painful. I spent most of the last decade as a Middle 
East specialist in uniform, not really understanding much about 
the way in which China operated. But I remember vividly getting 
a letter from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) after 
the massive hack of over 22 million people's--Federal 
Government employees' records, saying, ``Thank you for your 
service but your records have been hacked.''


 Senator King, I wanted to start with a question to you. The 
comprehensive report outlines many key steps that the Federal 
Government can take to prevent and mitigate the effects of 
cyberattacks. However, the report is relatively quiet on how 
the Federal Government can help strengthen State and local 
government's ability to prevent against attacks.
    Just recently, the National Governors Association wrote a 
letter to House and Senate leadership, asking for funding to 
help State and local government defend against crippling 
cyberattacks amid the COVID-19 pandemic. And even before this 
crisis, legislation was introduced to both the House and Senate 
to create a sizable Federal cybersecurity grant program for 
State and local governments.
    We all know that our collective cybersecurity is only as 
good as our weakest link, to your last point that you were just 
making, so it is critical that we work to improve our nation's 
cyber resiliency down to our smallest localities. Did you 
examine the possibility of Federal support for State and local 
cybersecurity, and if so, what were your conclusions?
    Senator King. We absolutely did, and, in fact, a major wave 
of ransomware has attacked our cities and towns.
    Senator Hassan. Yes.
    Senator King. We have had small towns in Maine that have 
been talked about--that have had hits of ransomware. I think 
there was something like 45 mentions of State, local, Tribal 
governments.


 So I think there is an argument, a good argument to be made 
for a special select committee. And frankly, one of the things 
we talked about was having the membership of that committee be 
the leadership of the various committees, such as this one. 
That is who would be the members, the Chair and the Ranking 
Member, or designees. And I think there is a way to do it, and 
I realize, jurisdiction is life around here. But I think this 
is a moment like the 1970s where there is a specialized area 
that is incredibly important to the future of the country, and 
right now, as Senator Johnson said, you can have a very simple 
bill and it takes years. And I do not want to go home after a 
cyberattack and say, ``Well, Congress really--we were talking 
about that and there were a couple of bills, but there were 
four different committees that had jurisdiction, and it was 
really hard.'' I do not think that is going to wash with my 
constituents.


 Senator Sinema. Yes, I am. Thank you so much, Chairman 
Johnson and Ranking Member Peters for holding today's hearing, 
and I want to also thank our witnesses for your service to the 
Commission and for participating today.
    As our country navigates the coronavirus pandemic, we 
clearly see the importance of cohesive strategies to ensure 
public safety. And this pandemic has also shown us the need to 
fortify our cybersecurity. Overnight, many Americans expanded 
their virtual footprints through telework, virtual schooling, 
telemedicine, and virtual social gatherings. We will continue 
to face immense challenges from the coronavirus pandemic for 
some time, and we must take steps to ensure our networks are 
secure.
    The parallel between these two threats should also make us 
ask whether the United States is prepared to sustain and 
recover from a potential cyberattack. I hope today we can look 
at this Commission report through the lens of the ongoing 
pandemic and identify some of the challenges we need to tackle 
now so we are better prepared for the next crisis.


  One of the clear examples is this continuity of the 
economy. The old model in our industry, in electricity, was 
reliability. There was a cost associated with an outage and we 
could figure out how reliable the equipment must be in order to 
prevent that cost. The notion of resilience says this is how my 
system operates under abnormal conditions, whether it is a 
hurricane, a snowstorm, a COVID virus, or a cyberattack. The 
only way that we will be able to continue the economy and 
provide an American way of life that we are all used to is for 
the private sector to pitch, not catch, and to work with the 
Federal Government and the State and local governments, whether 
it is the fusion centers, the Governors themselves, or the 
State and local government, to really think about a different 
way to turn the economy back on and get us back on our feet.
    This Commission's report, I think, deals with a lot of 
those important issues, and I think it is really important to 
consider the ramifications of that going forward.


  A couple of months after I arrived here to the U.S. Senate 
we suffered a terrible attack on 9/11, that we all remember. 
And then terrorism became our threat. Today that is still a 
threat. Communism is not. Fascism and Nazism is not. But 
security threats, they evolve from the use of cyberattacks. 
That is a major threat to our security as a Nation.
    The reason why we have succeeded and came out of 9/11 is 
extraordinary leadership, and not just the leadership of our 
President--I commend him--and not just the leadership of those 
in the Congress. But I want to again raise up Tom Kean, the 
former Governor of New Jersey. And I want to raise up, if I 
could, Lee Hamilton, a great leader in the House of 
Representatives. Pretty extraordinary leadership that they 
provided to the 9/11 Commission. And to Susan Collins and to 
Joe Lieberman, who provided extraordinary leadership to our 
Committee, extraordinary leadership to our Committee. They led 
the adoption of almost unanimous adoption of virtually every 
one of the recommendations.

",Strengthening National Security in the Face of Cyber Threats,"The excerpt highlights discussions from a Senate hearing on cybersecurity, emphasizing the need for cohesive strategies to protect against cyberattacks. Participants discuss various aspects, including the role of the Federal Government in supporting state and local cybersecurity efforts, the importance of resilience in critical infrastructure, and parallels between cybersecurity preparedness and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The dialogue underscores the urgency of addressing evolving security threats and commends past leadership in tackling challenges like terrorism."

We are identifying and preventing malign foreign actors and 
        nation-states from interfering in our elections and protecting 
        our election infrastructure, as part of our broader mission to 
        safeguard and secure cyber space; and
   We are aggressively responding to the threat posed by 
        China--now and in the future.


 election security
    DHS is committed to ensuring that our election system functions 
free from interference, both foreign and domestic. In that vein, the 
administration has continually called out malign actors, such as China, 
Russia, and Iran, which seek to interfere in our elections and threaten 
our democracy.
    DHS, through our Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency 
(CISA), continues to make progress securing the election systems and 
our Nation's critical infrastructure. The 2018 mid-term elections were 
the most secure in modern history, and DHS is working diligently with 
State and local election officials to make the 2020 elections even more 
secure.
    As such, CISA is currently working with representatives from all 50 
States, thousands of local jurisdictions, and our election technology 
partners to make sure they have the resources they need to keep our 
elections secure and resilient.


 This hearing provides Members of the committee with the opportunity 
to focus on international terrorism threats, including the threats to 
the homeland resulting from the resurgence of ISIS in Syria, and the 
rise in domestic terrorism incidents and recent shootings, including 
those inspired by or related to militias, conspiracy theorists, or 
violent.
	 My primary domestic security concerns are how to maintain a 
United--United States by:
   preventing foreign fighters and foreign trained fighters 
        from entering the United States undetected;
   countering international and home-grown violent extremism;
   preserving Constitutional rights and due process for all 
        persons;
   addressing the uncontrolled proliferation of long-guns that 
        are designed for battlefields and not hunting ranges;
   controlling access to firearms for those who are deemed to 
        be too dangerous to fly;
   protecting critical infrastructure from physical and cyber 
        attack;
   creating equity and fairness in our Nation's immigration 
        policies; and
   strengthening the capacity of the Department of Homeland 
        Security and the Department of Justice to meet the challenges 
        posed by weapons of mass destruction.


  As the Nation heads toward Election Day in the midst of a 
persistent pandemic and simmering social unrest, a new Pew Research 
Center survey finds that Americans' deep partisan divide, dueling 
information ecosystems, and divergent responses to conspiracy theories 
and misinformation are all fueling uncertainty and conflict surrounding 
the Presidential election.


qanon
    Is comprised of a loose collection of conspiracy theories that 
followers believe and will go to great lengths to act on those beliefs.
    Anon followers believe, without foundation in truth that the world 
is run by a secret cabal of Satan-worshipping Democrats and Hollywood 
celebrities who are engaged in wide-scale child trafficking, 
pedophilia, and cannibalism.
    The followers or believers in QAnon have not room for nuance or 
rational thought there is only good versus evil and any disagreement in 
their minds is evidence of abject depravity in the form of child 
murder.
    In recent weeks, President Trump has praised followers of QAnon 
followers, a QAnon-backed candidate is all but assured a place in the 
U.S. House of Representatives in the next Congress.
    Trump went so far as to accuse his Presidential opponent of 
``pedophilia,'' feeding the QAnon attack machine.


 QAnon and their followers will create false narratives about 
persons, businesses, or institutions without fear of reprisals in the 
form of court actions.
    On May 30, 2019, the FBI issued an Intelligence Bulletin on Anti-
Government, Identity-Based, and Fringe Political Conspiracy Theories 
Very Likely Motivate Some Domestic Extremists to Commit Criminal, 
Sometimes Violent Activity that designated QAnon as a ``domestic terror 
threat'' because of its potential to incite extremist violence.
    In spite of this, several U.S. Congressional candidates for the 
2020 November election proclaim support for the QAnon conspiracy.
    Several key events from 2017 to 2020 have contributed to its 
spread, including Jeffrey Epstein's arrest and death, and the 
coronavirus pandemic lockdowns.
    It does not help matters to add Federal Government agents in 
unmarked vehicles pulling people off the streets of Portland.
    What started out as a primarily U.S.-based conspiracy theory, has 
expanded to gain international recognition.
    Currently, QAnon followers seem to be propagating misinformation 
pertaining to both COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) and the George 
Floyd protests, all while membership across various digital platforms, 
such as Facebook, seem to be on the rise.
	 QAnon adherents have been disrupted from carrying out violent 
attacks based on the beliefs espoused by the conspiracies peddled.
    A California man was arrested in 2018 after being found with bomb-
making materials with the intent to construct an explosive device that 
he wanted to use to blow up a satanic temple monument at the Illinois 
Capitol rotunda in order to ``make Americans aware of Pizzagate'' and 
``the New World Order'' who were dismantling society.
    In another case a Nevada man used an armored truck to block traffic 
on the Hoover Dam Bypass Bridge and held up signs--then he fled to 
Arizona where he was arrested.
    At the time of his arrest he referenced QAnon conspiracy theories 
and discussed related conspiratorial beliefs.
    The Pew Center discovered through surveys that in this environment, 
the QAnon conspiracy theories have become another area of partisan 
divide.


 battle to defeat isis and al-qaeda
    I will never forget September 11, 2001, when 2,977 men, women, and 
children were murdered by 19 hijackers--15 of whom were Saudi 
nationals, who took control of commercial aircraft and used them as 
missiles.
    I stood on the East Front steps of the Capitol on September 11, 
2001, along with 150 members of the House of Representatives and sang 
``God Bless America.''
    We did not know if there was another plane or other follow-on 
attacks being attempted.
    We did know that the American People needed to know that their 
Government was still here ready to serve and protect them from harm.
    The days and weeks following the attacks we were uncertain what 
threat might come and how many lives might be lost as we worked to put 
resources in place to deal with an enemy that might be among us.
    We did not have to worry about the President of the United States 
dividing Americans and pitting us against each other with wild 
conspiracies or aggravating old wounds based upon race, ethnicity, or 
religion.


 Conspiracies were used in 2016 to stoke fear and hate against then-
Presidential Candidate Hilary Clinton.


We will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections. 
We are working closely with our Federal, State, and local 
partners, as well as the private sector to share information, 
bolster security, and identify and disrupt any threats.
    Just recently, for example, we shared threat indicators 
with both Facebook and Twitter that allowed them to take down 
fake accounts created as part of a Russian disinformation 
campaign before those accounts could develop a broader 
following.
    Turning to the cyber arena. We are focused on an 
increasingly diverse array of threats from our cyber 
adversaries from State-sponsored cyber intrusions by nation-
states like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, to 
sophisticated cyber criminals seeking to exploit technical 
vulnerabilities primarily for personal profit.


 Prepared Statement of Christopher A. Wray
                           September 17, 2020
    Good afternoon, Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Rogers, and 
Members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear 
before you today to discuss the current threats to the United States 
homeland. I am pleased to be here representing the nearly 37,000 
dedicated men and women of the FBI.
    While the COVID-19 pandemic has presented unique and unprecedented 
challenges to the FBI workforce, I am proud of their dedication to our 
mission of protecting the American people and upholding the 
Constitution. Hostile foreign actors, violent extremists, and 
opportunistic criminal elements have seized upon this environment. As a 
result, we are facing aggressive and sophisticated threats on many 
fronts. Whether it is terrorism now moving at the speed of social 
media, or the increasingly blended threat of cyber intrusions and 
State-sponsored economic espionage, or malign foreign influence and 
interference or active shooters and other violent criminals threatening 
our communities, or the scourge of opioid trafficking and abuse, or 
hate crimes, human trafficking, crimes against children--the list of 
threats we are worried about is not getting any shorter, and none of 
the threats on that list are getting any easier.


 Many FTOs use various digital communication platforms to reach 
individuals they believe may be susceptible and sympathetic to violent 
terrorist messages. However, no group has been as successful at drawing 
people into its perverse ideology as ISIS, which has proven dangerously 
competent at employing such tools. ISIS uses traditional media 
platforms as well as wide-spread social media campaigns to propagate 
its ideology. Terrorists in ungoverned spaces--both physical and 
virtual--readily disseminate propaganda and training materials to 
attract easily influenced individuals around the world to their cause. 
With the broad distribution of social media, terrorists can spot, 
assess, recruit, and radicalize vulnerable persons of all ages in the 
United States either to travel to foreign lands or to conduct an attack 
on the homeland. Through the internet, terrorists anywhere overseas now 
have direct access to our local communities to target and recruit our 
citizens and spread their message faster than was imagined just a few 
years ago.
    We remain concerned that groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq 
and ash-Sham (``ISIS'') and al-Qaeda intend to carry out large-scale 
attacks in the United States. Despite their territorial defeat in Iraq 
and Syria, ISIS remains relentless and ruthless in its campaign of 
violence against the West and has aggressively promoted its hateful 
message, attracting like-minded violent extremists. The message is not 
tailored solely to those who overtly express signs of radicalization. 
It is seen by many who use messaging apps and participate in social 
networks. Ultimately, many of the individuals drawn to ISIS seek a 
sense of belonging.
    Echoing other terrorist groups, ISIS has advocated lone-offender 
attacks in Western countries. Recent ISIS videos and propaganda have 
specifically advocated attacks against soldiers, law enforcement, and 
intelligence community personnel.
    As noted above, ISIS is not the only terrorist group of concern. 
Al-Qaeda maintains its desire for large-scale, spectacular attacks. 
While continued counterterrorism pressure has degraded the group's 
Afghanistan-Pakistan senior leadership, in the near term, al-Qaeda is 
more likely to focus on building its international affiliates and 
supporting small-scale, readily achievable attacks in key regions such 
as East and West Africa. Simultaneously, over the last year, propaganda 
from al-Qaeda leaders seeks to inspire individuals to conduct their own 
attacks in the United States and the West. For example, the December 
2019 attack at Naval Air Station Pensacola demonstrates that groups 
such as al-Qaeda continue to be interested in encouraging attacks on 
U.S. soil.


 election security
    In less than 2 months, Americans will exercise one of their most 
important and cherished freedoms; the right to vote in a democratic 
election. Our Nation is confronting multi-faceted foreign threats 
seeking to both influence our National policies and public opinion, and 
cause harm to our National dialog. The FBI and our interagency partners 
remain concerned about, and focused on, the covert and overt influence 
measures used by certain adversaries in their attempts to sway U.S. 
voters' preferences and perspectives, shift U.S. policies, increase 
discord in the United States, and undermine the American people's 
confidence in our democratic processes.
    Foreign influence operations--which include covert, coercive, or 
corrupt actions by foreign governments to influence U.S. political 
sentiment or public discourse or interfere in our processes 
themselves--are not a new problem. But the interconnectedness of the 
modern world, combined with the anonymity of the internet, have changed 
the nature of the threat and how the FBI and its partners must address 
it. This year's election cycle, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, provides 
ample opportunity for hostile foreign actors to conduct disinformation 
campaigns and foreign influence operations in an effort to mislead, sow 
discord, and, ultimately, undermine confidence in our democratic 
institutions and values and in our Government's response to our current 
health crisis.
    Foreign influence operations have taken many forms and used many 
tactics over the years. Most widely reported these days are attempts by 
adversaries--hoping to reach a wide swath of Americans covertly from 
outside the United States--to use false personas and fabricated stories 
on social media platforms to discredit U.S. individuals and 
institutions.
    The FBI is the lead Federal agency responsible for investigating 
foreign influence operations. In the fall of 2017, the Foreign 
Influence Task Force (``FITF'') was established to identify and 
counteract malign foreign influence operations targeting the United 
States. The FITF is led by the Counterintelligence Division and is 
composed of agents, analysts, and professional staff from the 
Counterintelligence, Cyber, Counterterrorism, and Criminal 
Investigative Divisions. It is specifically charged with identifying 
and combating foreign influence operations targeting democratic 
institutions and values inside the United States. In all instances, the 
FITF strives to protect democratic institutions and public confidence; 
develop a common operating picture; raise adversaries' costs; and, 
reduce their overall asymmetric advantage.
	 The task force brings the FBI's National security and traditional 
criminal investigative expertise under one umbrella to prevent foreign 
influence in our elections. This better enables us to frame the threat, 
to identify connections across programs, to aggressively investigate as 
appropriate, and--importantly--to be more agile. Coordinating closely 
with our partners and leveraging relationships we have developed in the 
technology sector, we had a number of instances where we were able to 
quickly relay threat indicators that those companies used to take swift 
action, blocking budding abuse of their platforms.
    Following the 2018 mid-term elections, we reviewed the threat and 
the effectiveness of our coordination and outreach. As a result of this 
review, we further expanded the scope of the FITF. Previously, our 
efforts to combat malign foreign influence focused solely on the threat 
posed by Russia. Utilizing lessons learned over the last year-and-a-
half, the FITF is widening its aperture to confront malign foreign 
operations of China, Iran, and other global adversaries. To address 
this expanding focus and wider set of adversaries and influence 
efforts, we have also added resources to maintain permanent ``surge'' 
capability on election and foreign influence threats.
    We have also further refined our approach. All efforts are based on 
a three-pronged approach, which includes investigations and operations; 
information and intelligence sharing; and a strong partnership with the 
private sector. Through the efforts of the FITF, and lessons learned 
from both the 2016 and 2018 elections, the FBI is actively engaged in 
identifying, detecting, and disrupting threats to our elections and 
ensuring both the integrity of our democracy is preserved and the will 
of the American people is fulfilled.
    Protecting policy makers is an important part of our efforts to 
combat malign foreign influence and protect our elections. As you are 
aware, the FBI and our interagency partners have been providing on-
going election security threat briefings to Congress. We will continue 
to do so throughout the fall and into the future, where there is 
actionable intelligence.


  In 2017, the Chinese military conspired to hack Equifax and made 
off with the sensitive personal information of 150 million Americans--
we are talking nearly half of the American population and most American 
adults. Our data is not the only thing at stake here--so is our health, 
livelihood, and security


   cyber
    With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, the nature of the cyber 
threat has become increasingly concerning. As more individuals telework 
and increasingly use the cloud, we encounter less secure networks. As a 
result, the scope of our cyber threats has changed, the impact has 
deepened, and many of the players have become more dangerous as we have 
become increasingly vulnerable. We are still seeing hack after hack and 
breach after breach. We hear about it daily in the news. The more we 
shift to the internet as the conduit and the repository for everything 
we use and share and manage, the more danger we are in.
    Today we are worried about a wider-than-ever range of threat 
actors, from multi-national cyber syndicates to nation-state 
adversaries. We are concerned about a wider-than-ever gamut of methods 
continually employed in new ways, like the targeting of managed service 
providers--MSPs--as a way to access scores of victims by hacking just 
one provider.


 Cyber crimes like these, directed by the Chinese government's 
intelligence services, threaten not only the United States but also 
every other country that supports fair play, international norms, and 
the rule of law, and they also seriously undermine China's desire to 
become a respected leader in world affairs.
    Theft of intellectual property is not the only cyber threat 
presented by the People's Republic of China (``PRC'') government. They 
are also working to obtain controlled defense technology and developing 
the ability to use cyber means to complement any future real-world 
conflict. All of them, and others, are working to simultaneously 
strengthen themselves, and weaken the United States. And we are taking 
all these nation-state threats very seriously.


Despite these successes, ISIS has repeatedly demonstrated the 
ability to rebound from severe losses over the past 6 years by relying 
on a dedicated cadre of veteran mid-level commanders, extensive 
clandestine networks, and downturns in CT pressure to persevere. The 
group has appointed a new leader, Muhammad Sa'id Abdal-Rahman al-
Mawla--also known as Hajji Abdallah--and its spokesman in May trumpeted 
recent attacks in Iraq and Syria and promised additional operations 
around the world. The group has conducted a steady rate of 
assassinations, and IED and mortar attacks in mostly rural parts of 
northern and central Iraq and eastern Syria, including a series of 
assaults in May that killed and wounded dozens of Iraqi soldiers. These 
operations are celebrated in graphic propaganda videos that showcase 
the group's battlefield prowess. ISIS is also working to release 
thousands of terror group members and their families currently detained 
in prisons and living in camps in northeastern Syria, where our foreign 
partners face growing security and humanitarian challenges.
    Outside of Iraq and Syria, ISIS continues to prioritize the 
expansion and reinforcement of its global enterprise, which now 
encompasses approximately 20 branches and networks. In January, the 
group's chief spokesman heralded the group's growth and pledged to 
expand its attacks including against Israel, echoing earlier statements 
made by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi prior to his death. Since last year, ISIS 
leaders have touted the strength of the group's transnational network 
by launching 5 global campaigns that incorporate attack claims and 
propaganda videos from its branches and networks. Individually, these 
ISIS branches and networks have made uneven progress in advancing the 
group's agenda. In several parts of Africa, ISIS groups conduct 
frequent attacks against local security forces and have expanded their 
safe havens, while coalition operations and attacks from local rivals 
have stunted the group's growth in Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, and 
Yemen.


   al-qaeda
    CT pressure against al-Qaeda has diminished its cadre of veteran 
leaders and ability to strike the West, but the group's global network 
still poses a significant threat to U.S. and allied interests. Al-
Qaeda's significant leadership losses include AQIM leader Abdelmalek 
Droukdal in June 2020, AQAP leader Qasim al-Rimi in January 2020, the 
leader of AQIS in September 2019, and several senior Syria-based 
leaders, including deputy amir Khalid al-Aruri and Sari Shihab. 
However, several of the group's remaining senior leaders continue to 
find safe haven in Iran, and will likely play a key role in the group's 
efforts to reconstitute its leadership.
    Leadership losses have not diminished the group's determination to 
strike American and Western targets. Through its propaganda, al-Qaeda 
leaders continue to exhort their adherents to strike U.S. persons and 
installations: In February, AQAP media hailed the Pensacola attack and 
issued a call for supporters to attack U.S. and Israeli interests 
around the world. Earlier propaganda lauded al-Shabaab's attacks 
against U.S. military personnel in Kenya and Somalia, linking those 
operations to al-Qaeda's global response to the movement of the U.S. 
embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Al-Qaeda has also attempted to 
capitalize on global unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic in its media 
products and messaging.


COVID-19 and Heightened Instability.--The COVID-19 pandemic may 
fuel greater instability and degrade humanitarian conditions in several 
parts of the developing world, providing terrorists with opportunities 
to undermine local governments and expand their safe havens. Prior to 
the outbreak, terrorists groups were already enjoying success 
exploiting endemic instability to entrench and expand in parts of 
Africa and the Middle East. In these regions, local authorities often 
lack the capability or will to mitigate the terrorist threat, while 
intractable conflicts and economic instability render society 
vulnerable to violent extremist encroachment. The spread of COVID-19 
may worsen these conditions by sapping governments' CT and security 
resources and depressing local economies. Meanwhile, terrorists have 
recognized the potential opportunities of the COVID-19 pandemic and 
have accelerated attacks against over-extended security forces, used 
propaganda to blame the outbreak on their enemies or characterize the 
disease as divine punishment, and moved to undermine civilian 
confidence in the ability of local governments to care for civilians.


 Emergent Technologies.--The CT community is moving aggressively to 
keep pace with the rapid development of pertinent technologies 
including advances in dual-use technology, UAS, 3D printing, ubiquitous 
end-to-end encryption, cryptocurrency, and new social media platforms, 
a complex challenge that demands a whole-of-Government response and 
partnership with private industry. Terrorists have historically proven 
adept at harnessing these and other emergent technologies to 
disseminate their propaganda, attract new members, advance their 
weapons capabilities, and support operations, including the development 
of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) capabilities. 
Regarding social media, terrorist groups are increasingly transitioning 
to smaller, less-visible platforms to share content following 
intensified voluntary efforts by prominent companies to restrict 
violent and extremist material consistent with their terms of service. 
Terrorists are also looking to exploit the move toward greater 
encryption to safeguard their communications. For its part, in 
coordination with State, FBI, and DHS, NCTC has worked with U.S. 
technology companies, including several members of the Global Internet 
Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT), a private industry initiative and 
now a non-governmental organization, to provide technology companies 
with information about how terrorists use the internet, including 
specific key words and logos. The Center has also worked with members 
of the GIFCT to help identify terrorist content.


 Mr. Thompson. Thank you. Can you tell me if, as of this 
date, you have information that Russia is trying to influence 
the election for 2020?
    Mr. Wray. Yes. I think the intelligence community's 
consensus is that Russia continues to try to influence our 
election, primarily through what we would call malign foreign 
influence as opposed to what we saw in 2016, where there was 
also an effort to target election infrastructure, cyber 
targeting. We have not seen that second part yet this year or 
this cycle, but we certainly have seen very active, very active 
efforts by the Russians to influence our election in 2020 
through what I would call more the malign foreign influence 
side of things, social media, use of proxies, State media, on-
line journals, et cetera, in effort to both sow decisiveness 
and discord, and--and I think the intelligence community has 
assessed this publicly--to primarily to denigrate Vice 
President Biden and what the Russians see as kind-of an anti-
Russian establishment. That is essentially what we are seeing 
in 2020.


 Director Wray, the FBI on May 30, 2019, issued the 
intelligence bulletin on anti-Government identity base and 
fringe political conspiracy theories very likely motivate some 
domestic extremists to commit criminal, sometimes violent 
activity. I think you focused or made the point today in your 
testimony that you act more toward the ideology or you don't 
investigate ideology; you are determined to assess the threat 
to the United States.
    So I am interested--QAnon activity has resulted in arrest 
of persons planning to carry out violent acts based on the 
nonsense spouted in web forums and social media that form the 
core of QAnon beliefs. How do you characterize that 
organization?
    Mr. Wray. How do I characterize QAnon?
    Ms. Jackson Lee. Yes. QAnon activity has resulted in arrest 
of persons planning to carry out violent acts. How do you 
assess that organization as it relates to violent acts?
    Mr. Wray. So we view QAnon as essentially less of an 
organization and more of a sort-of a complex set of conspiracy 
theories, and certainly we have had cases that properly 
predicate cases involving violence where people have been 
motivated by some of those conspiracy theories. But as you 
said, we don't investigate the ideology or the conspiracy 
theory itself. I don't think we have seen lethal attacks 
involving that kind of motivation, but we have certainly----
    Ms. Jackson Lee. So your investigations would be driven 
based upon any violent act?
    Mr. Wray. Correct. No matter what ideology or belief it is 
of domestic violent extremism, we look at three things: No. 1, 
violence or a threat of violence; No. 2, a Federal crime 
obviously; and then, third, the motivation that fuels it. We 
have to have those 3 things to open an investigation.


  Can you share with us regarding social media platforms, 
which is primarily the means by which this interference effort 
is being pushed, how is the FBI working with the social media 
platforms to ensure our election security and to minimize fake 
profiles and foreign influence in the attitudes and 
perspectives of the American people?
    Mr. Wray. Well, Congressman, thank you for the question.
    You are correct that we are working increasingly closely 
and have been building over the last few years in our working 
with the social media sector, in particular, but also other 
kinds of technology companies to thwart [inaudible].
    Mr. Higgins. I lost the director's audio, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Wray. We will take leads that we have, information that 
we have, work very closely with some of the key social media 
companies. We feed them information, and they are able to take 
action on their platforms using their terms of service or terms 
of use to shut down and kick off fake accounts, trolls, bots, 
et cetera. In turn, a lot of times what will happen, and this 
is happening more and more, which is great, they are sending 
back to us new accounts they have identified that then allow us 
to have more leads to pursue more investigative activity.
	 So I mentioned one example in my opening statement that 
recently occurred where we were able to pass information to 
Facebook and Twitter. They were able to shut down Russian 
influence accounts, really, right before they could ever build 
a following. The faster we can do that and the more agile way 
we can do that, the better, and the reason for that I think is 
important for people to understand.
    Misinformation or disinformation or fake information is 
only effective if it seems credible, and it is only credible if 
it was built up some reservoir of credibility, which means that 
these Russian efforts require a certain amount of time to build 
up kind-of a reservoir of credibility so that, when they are 
really active, people care what they have to say. If we are 
able to shut them down and knock them back quickly before they 
can really build up that credibility, then it is not going to 
stop it, but it means that it is much, much less effective. So 
we need more of that. We are having more of that.


 Mr. Langevin. That is good. My time is short. So let me 
jump to another topic. I also want to highlight the joint 
collaborative environment to allow analysts across Government 
and the private sector to work together to produce their cyber 
threat intelligent products. So that is another important one, 
but let me turn to elections because this is a very important 
topic. We only have about 7 weeks to go until the election, and 
early voting begins Monday. Misinformation and disinformation 
from foreign and domestic actors are wide-spread. We have 
discussed some of this topic already this morning.
    Director Wray, who is responsible for coordinating election 
security across the interagency? To put it bluntly, who is in 
charge? I also want to note, who is responsible for 
coordinating efforts to combat election-related misinformation 
and disinformation?
    Take them in order there.
    Mr. Wray. So the FBI takes the lead on malign foreign 
influence domestically, and we work closely through our foreign 
influence task force. We have people from NSA, for example, on 
our task force. We work very closely, as I mentioned a few 
minutes ago, with the social media companies, and that is 
really an almost daily engagement. We engage through the 
foreign influence task force really every day, especially in 
the current run up to the election in the interagency on the 
malign foreign influence piece.
	Mr. Langevin. Who would you say is in charge at the 
interagency?
    Mr. Wray. I am sorry?
    Mr. Langevin. Who would you say is responsible for 
coordinating across the interagency? Who is in charge?
    Mr. Wray. Well, we all work together, just as we do against 
the terrorist threat. It is an interagency process. We take the 
lead on the malign foreign influence threat. DHS takes the lead 
on the election infrastructure hardening. ODNI takes the lead 
in terms of coordinating the intelligence analysis that comes 
out of it.
    Mr. Langevin. Who is responsible for combating the 
election-related misinformation/disinformation?
    Mr. Wray. I think the FBI takes the lead in combating that.
    Mr. Langevin. Well, this is--I appreciate your answer and 
perspective. I know my time has run out, but I will say this 
really underscores the need for a National cyber director so 
that across response we have someone that is identified as the 
person in charge. Working together is important. I highly 
support a collaborative environment. Also having someone in 
charge is essential. I know my time has expired.


 Miss Rice. Can I ask you to just talk a little bit more? 
You made reference earlier in response to a question about the 
collaboration that your agency has with social media platforms 
in terms of misinformation and disinformation. Can you just 
talk more about that? Because if people can't trust the 
information that they are getting, I mean, that just goes to 
the heart of, you know, really affecting, you know, what I 
think all of us on this committee want to do, which is 
everyone's right and ability to vote and base their decisions 
on facts, not misinformation and disinformation.
    Mr. Wray. So this is one of our key challenges, both for 
the FBI and for the interagency, and for the country. 
Misinformation/disinformation is not new, but what is new is 
the ability through social media to amplify it at scale in a 
much more challenging way. That is why the partnerships with 
the private sector, with Silicon Valley, the tech companies, et 
cetera, has become so critical to our efforts.
	 There are things that they can do, and they have resources 
to take responsibility for things that are happening on their 
own platforms much more quickly and within greater legal 
flexibility under their terms of use and terms of service than 
we could do through law enforcement means. So that is why that 
is part of the key effort. Now, we, the FBI, are not and can't 
be the truth police.
    Miss Rice. No.
    Mr. Wray. A lot of people don't understand that that is not 
how we go about deterring misinformation efforts and malign 
foreign influencers. We follow the threat. So if it is the 
Russians, we follow the Russian actors. We identify certain 
accounts. We talk to the social media companies. They take 
action. But we don't have people sitting on social media, 
trying to find things that look false and then wondering who 
did it. We go the other way. We look at the actor and then see 
what they are trying to spread.
    The social media companies, though, they can come at it in 
whatever way they want based on their terms of service, and 
they have resources that I envy sometimes that they can and 
should and are increasingly bringing to the fight. It is 
particularly of concern to us in the election context when 
Americans make the mistake of getting information about 
elections themselves from social media.
    So it is one thing to push out misinformation about a 
candidate or a policy or something else. But when information 
gets pushed out about where you go to vote, whether your 
polling place is open, whether it is closed, that kind of 
thing, we are trying to make sure Americans know to get 
information about where and when and how you vote, you need to 
go to your local election officials website and don't take it 
from social media.


 Ms. Torres Small. Thank you, Director Wray.
    Congressman Higgins and you also discussed Russian 
disinformation related to elections. Another way that Russia in 
particular is seeking to undermine Americans' recovery is with 
COVID-19 and the public health crisis through spreading that 
same disinformation on the virus and on future vaccines to 
create distrust within the public.
    Are there any distinct challenges in disrupting Russia's 
disinformation specifically on COVID-19 and vaccination 
efforts?
    Mr. Wray. Well, certainly, misinformation--we share your 
concerns about misinformation about COVID, whether it is 
misinformation about the infectiousness of the disease itself 
or misinformation about treatments and cures, vaccines. In some 
instances, we are able to and we have pursued cases for various 
scams and schemes, you know, essentially fraud, people pitching 
fraudulent tests and cures, and people claiming to have the 
vaccine, you know, things like that.
    So when there is sort-of fraud engaged, we are able to use 
law enforcement tools to go after it. But as I said in the 
election context, and you are right to kind-of draw the 
analogy, we are not the truth police. Especially on something 
like medical issues, we defer to CDC and the medical 
professionals to correct misinformation there. But it is 
important that people get their information, in this context, 
from the medical professionals and not from things like social 
media.
    Ms. Torres Small. Just reclaiming my time briefly. Just to 
stay on Russia and making sure that Russia is not spreading 
disinformation on this, you mentioned that a key strategy of 
working to disrupt Russian voices of disinformation was 
stopping them before they gained credibility. So I wanted to 
see if in the COVID-19 space there is an extra challenge there, 
if, for example, Russian disinformation is gaining credibility, 
for example, through anti-vaxxers.
    Mr. Wray. Well, certainly, as we discussed and as you 
mentioned, the essence of disinformation, the only way it works 
is to do it through voices that are viewed as credible. So if 
there were--and I'm not sure that I can think of a specific 
example off the top of my head, but if there were a situation 
where a credible voice that people really paid attention to as 
a medical expert was pushing out under the guise of being a 
medical expert flawed, badly flawed and dangerous information, 
then that would be a source of particular concern.


  But if I could just ask you this question. I know you 
testified on a lot of different aspects. What is your biggest 
concern right now about election security going forward for 
this long?
    Mr. Wray. You know, obviously, there is a lot of aspects of 
it that we are concerned about, and you touched on some of 
them, but I think in many ways what concerns me the most is the 
steady drumbeat of misinformation and sort-of amplification of 
small or cyber intrusions that contribute over time, I worry 
that they will contribute over time to a lack of confidence of 
American voters and citizens in the validity of their vote.
    I think that would be a perception, not a reality. I think 
Americans can and should have confidence in our election system 
and certainly in our democracy, but I worry that people will 
take on a feeling of futility because of all of the noise and 
confusion that is generated. That is a very hard problem to 
combat.

    A top communications official for the administration's coronavirus 
response urged President Trump's supporters to prepare for an armed 
insurrection after a contested election and accused government 
scientists of ``sedition'' in a Facebook Live chat that he described in 
detail to The Washington Post on Monday.
    Michael Caputo, assistant secretary for public affairs at the 
Department of Health and Human Services, which is overseeing the 
coronavirus response, leveled the accusations and promoted other 
conspiracy theories in a Facebook Live event first reported by the New 
York Times. Caputo confirmed the authenticity of the video in comments 
he made to The Post.
    ``Since joining the administration my family and I have been 
continually threatened and in and out of criminal court dealing with 
harassment prosecutions,'' Caputo said in a statement. ``This weighs 
heavily on us and we deeply appreciate the friendship and support of 
President Trump as we address these matters and keep our children 
safe.''


Several Democratic lawmakers, including Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) 
and Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), called late Monday for Caputo's 
firing.
    ``Secretary Azar has a basic responsibility to ensure our public 
health experts are able to do their jobs, our COVID-19 response is not 
undermined by misinformation or conspiracy theories, and the data used 
to inform our efforts is free of political interference,'' Murray said 
in a statement.
    Noting that Caputo has said the president asked him to oversee a 
$250 million campaign ``intended to help America toget back to 
normal,'' DeLauro said, ``We now know this is a propaganda campaign 
that must be defunded immediately. It is not the mission of the 
Department of Health and Human Services to get the President 
reelected.''
    House Democrats on the select subcommittee on the coronavirus 
crisis also announced that they had launched an investigation into 
political interference in the CDC's science reports on the pandemic.
    The White House declined to comment on the controversy Monday.


 Ms. Clarke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank our Ranking 
Member Rogers. As our Nation faces immeasurable threats from 
the rise of White Supremacist terrorist groups to the risk of 
cyber attacks crippling our critical infrastructure, this 
committee has an obligation to conduct oversight and ensure 
that the Executive branch is doing its job, but Congress can 
only fulfill our Constitutional role if the Executive branch 
follows the law and appears before us when subpoenaed.


 Mr. Wray. We have certainly investi- --if I may finish. We 
certainly have investigated voter fraud committed by mail. It 
has typically been at the local level.
    Mrs. Watson Coleman. In very isolated circumstances, I 
suspect. I'm just wondering how often you get to speak to the 
attorney general, and if you would use your good graces and the 
respect that we have for you to sort of ask him to stop 
spreading such misinformation about voting integrity.


Chairman Thompson. Thank you very much.
    The Chair recognizes the gentlelady from Texas.
    Ms. Jackson Lee. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your 
generosity. I just want to put on the record one question and 
introduce elements into the record.
    Is the DOJ contemplating or has it contemplated opening an 
investigation into domestic terrorism charges against BLM? I 
would like to have that on the record for a response by both 
our witnesses today. Black Lives Matter. If so, what is the 
status?
    New York Times--I am going to introduce this. The New York 
Times, ``Federal Officers Deployed in Portland Didn't Have 
Proper Training, DHS Memo Said.''
    I will just do unanimous consent at the end, Mr. Chairman.
    Washington Post, ``ICE flew detainees to Virginia so the 
planes could transport agents to DC protests. A huge 
coronavirus outbreak followed.''
    ABC News, ``Deaths at protests from Kenosha to Portland, 
but motives tell a different story.'' This indicates who were 
actually involved in that.
    Finally, ``Political Divides Conspiracy Theories and 
Divergent News Sources Heading Into 2020 Election''--Pew 
Research Center--43 percent of Republicans identify fraud as a 
major problem with voting by mail versus 11 percent of 
Democrats.*

    what is qanon? the conspiracy theory tiptoeing into trump world
https://www.npr.org/2018/08/02/634749387/what-is-qanon-the-conspiracy-
        theory-tiptoeing-into-trump-world
August 2, 2018 5 o'clock AM ET
    As the cameras rolled on President Trump's campaign rally for GOP 
Rep. Ron DeSantis in Florida on Tuesday night, a peculiar sign appeared 
in view.
    ``We are Q.''
    Journalists at the event noted multiple attendees carrying signs 
and wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the name ``QAnon.''
    The shirts and signs are references to a conspiracy theory growing 
increasingly popular among those on the far-right--and a conspiracy 
theory about which the White House fielded a question from the media on 
Wednesday.
What is QAnon?
    The conspiracy theory centers on a mysterious and anonymous on-line 
figure--``Q.'' According to The Daily Beast, ``Q'' began posting on 
anonymous Internet message boards in October 2017. The person or 
persons behind the ``Q'' persona claim to possess a top-level security 
clearance and evidence of a world-wide criminal conspiracy.
What's the conspiracy theory?
    It goes like this: Special counsel Robert Mueller isn't actually 
investigating Trump and his 2016 campaign for their possible ties to 
Russia, and he's not really looking into Russian interference in the 
2016 Presidential election.


 ``Q'' has dropped ``breadcrumbs'' about coming events in the 
supposed investigation on a regular basis. The hints reference current 
political events, including the release of the Justice Department's 
Office of the Inspector General report in June.
    It should be noted that no part of the QAnon conspiracy theory has 
proved to be true, and multiple media outlets have debunked the 
theory's allegations.
Who believes in the conspiracy theory?
    For a while, QAnon posts were mostly limited to anonymous Internet 
message boards, like 4chan and 8chan. But over the past year, ``Q'' has 
gained a host of new believers and followers. A popular YouTube video 
explaining QAnon has racked up nearly 200,000 views, and according to 
NBC News, a mobile phone application related to the conspiracy theory 
climbed near the top of the Apple App Store rankings earlier this year.
    ``Q'' also counts several celebrities as followers and fans. 
Roseanne Barr has frequently tweeted about QAnon and has expressed a 
desire to meet ``Q.'' And in June, the sitcom star took to Twitter to 
share a phrase common among QAnon supporters--``wwg1wga,'' short for 
``where we go one, we go all.''
    Former Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling has also tweeted about 
the conspiracy theory and has shared QAnon videos on his Facebook page, 
according to The Daily Beast.


Why does it matter?
    QAnon may seem on its face like a fringe Internet conspiracy 
theory, but its explosion in popularity has led to several real-world 
incidents.
    In April, a group of QAnon believers took to the streets in 
Washington, DC, in support of ``Q'' and demanding answers from the 
Justice Department.
    And in June, a man driving an armored vehicle and carrying two 
firearms shut down a highway near the Hoover Dam while holding a sign 
reading ``Release the OIG report.''
    That appeared to be a reference to the Justice Department's Office 
of the Inspector General report that criticized the actions of former 
FBI Director James Comey for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email 
investigation. ``Q'' has hinted to followers on multiple occasions that 
Trump possesses a second IG report that would detail the criminal 
activities undertaken by Democrats.
    The man, Matthew Wright, was arrested after the incident and now 
faces terrorism charges. Last month, it was revealed that Wright penned 
letters to Trump and other government officials from jail bearing the 
``where we go one, we go all'' slogan.
    Even Michael Avenatti, the lawyer representing adult film actress 
Stormy Daniels, made an appearance in a series of QAnon posts earlier 
this week, which included images of his office building followed by an 
image of a man reportedly standing outside Avenatti's office. ``Q'' 
later posted that a ``message'' had been sent to Avenatti.
    In a tweet Wednesday, Avenatti appeared to respond, writing: ``The 
more conspiracy theorists attack me, the more confident I become. It 
shows they see me as a significant threat to Mr. Trump and his 
continuation in office.''


 And following Trump's rally in Florida, QAnon made its way into the 
White House briefing room Wednesday, when a reporter asked White House 
press secretary Sarah Sanders if Trump ``encouraged the support'' of 
rallygoers wearing ``Q'' shirts.
    ``The president condemns and denounces any group that would incite 
violence against another individual and certainly doesn't support 
groups that would promote that type of behavior,'' Sanders said.
    QAnon isn't the first conspiracy theory to make the jump from the 
Internet to the real world. In December 2016, a man fired a rifle 
inside Washington, DC.'s Comet Ping Pong pizzeria, citing the baseless 
``Pizzagate'' conspiracy theory that maintains that the restaurant is 
the center of a child sex ring involving top Democrats, including 
Clinton and Podesta.
    The ``Pizzagate'' conspiracy theory originated on fringe Internet 
sites before emerging in the mainstream. With the ever-increasing 
appearances of ``Q''-branded gear at Trump rallies, QAnon may be 
following the same path.

 Google tried to demonetize The Federalist. Amazon censors 
the Family Research Council. YouTube blocks videos from Senator 
Blackburn. Twitter censors the President, but they let the 
leader of Iran post a statement where he says they will strike 
a blow against American citizens. At the last hearing, our 
concerns were dismissed as ``conspiracy theories,'' despite 
this mounting evidence of biased actions against conservatives. 
Even though you are seeking to radically rewrite antitrust 
laws, Silicon Valley continues to use its power to carry your 
water. In fact, the vast majority of political contributions 
from the very firms you are targeting go to Democrats. You have 
even denied Republicans, and, more importantly, the American 
people the opportunity to hear from Twitter at the last hearing 
held by this subcommittee. Twitter, I will remind you, shadow 
banned four members of Congress. Four hundred thirty-five in 
the House, 100 in the Senate, 535. Four, only four, four 
conservative Republicans get shadow banned by Twitter, but when 
we asked you to bring them in, you said, nope, can't do that.


 Facebook offers another example. With the election rapidly 
approaching, we've seen the dangers of an ad-based, data-
mining-based business model where an online information 
platform like Facebook uses algorithms that maximize user 
attention in order to sell targeted ads. That essentially means 
that our information infrastructure of Facebook is actually 
incentivized to allow the rapid spread of toxic misinformation, 
disinformation, hate speech, attacks on black and brown 
speakers, in particular. Here, too we see the burden is felt 
disproportionately on black and brown communities.


That Big Tech systematically engages in viewpoint and 
information bias is increasingly obvious. Here are a few recent 
examples. Dr. Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist and professor at 
Stanford Medical School, has been accused of spreading medical 
misinformation by Google's YouTube, but only after he joined 
the White House's coronavirus Task Force. A deep investigation 
into Google by the Wall Street Journal found that the company 
``made algorithmic changes to its search results that favor big 
businesses over small ones.'' The investigation also found that 
Google modified its search results around topics like abortion 
and immigration. In June, Google colluded with NBC News to flex 
its muscles against the conservative news site, The Federalist, 
for minor violations of its ad policies in their comments 
section. In July, the search engine inexplicably stopped 
presenting search results for several leading conservative 
websites.


 A hundred and thirty years ago, a gigantic network industry 
arose as one of the greatest economic manifestations of the 
second Industrial Revolution in the United States, and that was 
the railroads. And Congress addressed many grievances and 
problems with the performance of the railroads in two 
fundamentally different ways. In 1887, it passed the first 
major Federal sectoral regulation creating the Interstate 
Commerce Commission to enforce the Interstate Commerce Act, 
which was a method of directly regulating competitive outcomes 
in the railroad industry. And in 1890, it enacted the Sherman 
Act, which very simply prohibited restraints of competition, 
conspiracy, and monopolization. It's 130 years later. The 
Interstate Commerce Commission and the Interstate Commerce Act 
are gone, but antitrust thrives, and competition thrives, and 
the success of the American economy thrives.",Challenges of Big Tech Bias and Antitrust Regulation,"The text outlines instances of bias and censorship by major tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, particularly against conservative voices. It highlights concerns about the spread of misinformation, hate speech, and selective censorship targeting certain political viewpoints. Additionally, the text discusses the historical context of antitrust regulation in response to the rise of powerful industries, drawing parallels between past regulation of the railroad industry and the current challenges posed by Big Tech monopolies."

These new and emerging security concerns include increased 
acts of aggression from China, Russia, and other malign actors, 
as well as an increase in asymmetrical threats, including 
cyber-attacks, hybrid warfare, terrorism, and climate change.


Russia has intensified its cyber and disinformation 
campaigns targeting NATO member States and partner States. They 
have interfered with the democratic processes, harbored cyber 
criminals, violated NATO airspace, and engaged in provocative 
military activities.


 Let that sink in for a minute. The Chinese Communist Party 
is aiding the activities of transnational criminal 
organizations, including the trafficking of humans, drugs, and 
weapons through money laundering.
    This is an issue I hope we can raise more attention on and 
work together to combat in regions around the world. As we 
focus on countering China and Russia aggression and the 
expansion in the Arctic, there's also an urgent need to address 
cybersecurity and cyber defense threats posed by China and 
Russia.
    As we saw just a few weeks ago, a cyber-attack can cripple 
the movement of vital goods while impacting the economy and 
disrupting daily lives. We saw that right here in America.
    I know addressing cyber concerns is one of several key 
components of NATO 2030. I look forward to working with this 
group as well as in my role as member of the House Armed 
Services Committee to address the cyber threats that NATO 
member nations face.


 Mr. Rasmussen. Thank you very much, Chair Keating, Ranking 
Member Fitzpatrick, Representatives Connolly and Scott. Thank 
you for your opening statements.
    And I'm so sorry that I cannot be with you in person today. 
There is no substitute for people-to-people contacts to keep 
friendships alive, and in my personal case, to spend time with 
my American grandchildren, and for the these reasons I look 
forward to the United States lifting travel restrictions from 
Europe.
    Now, NATO has been a successful peace movement for nearly 
75 years. This is because of true strength and capacity to 
adapt and determined American global leadership. Both are 
interconnected, and my view is that we are at a moment where 
both strengths must converge.
    Why? Because in 2021, the free world's greatest strengths 
are being weaponized by autocrats and dictators. Open trade is 
leveraged to coerce and co-opt.
    Free speech is abused to spread polarizing disinformation. 
Technological innovation intended for benign causes is turned 
to malign ends.


 NATO will have to agree on the extent to which China poses 
a direct security challenge and how that challenge should be 
met collectively. That includes the possibility of dialog and 
deeper cooperation with our partners in--our democratic 
partners in Asia that Secretary General Rasmussen talked to, 
but it will also need to include greater intelligence and 
information sharing, closer coordination of maritime and other 
military activities as China encroaches on the North Atlantic 
area, and contingency planning and exercises geared to the 
possibility of direct military confrontation.
    Second, on cyber, NATO has taken important steps to address 
the growing cyber threat to its security, including recognizing 
as early as 2014 that a cyber-attack could trigger Article 5's 
collective defense commitment. It now extended that commitment 
in the--at its Brussels Summit.
    And yet, the cyber domain continues to evolve in complex 
and dangerous ways, and in this domain, as is so often the 
case--in this domain the best defense may well be a good 
offense.
    That has not yet been NATO's focus, but it needs to start 
doing so. While NATO has agreed that it could respond to a 
cyber-attack with other means, it will also need to develop the 
doctrine and capabilities to employ cyber offensively to 
enhance deterrence of such attacks.


Ms. Gottemoeller. All right. Very good.
    About your very important cyber question, the point is that 
NATO has taken steps in recent years, especially with the 
adoption of policies that allow for individual member cyber--
member States to provide cyber effects to NATO should there be 
attacks during the course of a crisis or conflict.


 Mr. Scott. Ma'am, thank you very much. My time has almost 
expired. My concern is what the cyber-attacks are doing to our 
economy and, as we all know, the economic ties are strong. They 
could be stronger and should be stronger.


 The issue that I think NATO needs to focus on more is cyber 
offense. That is, what are the cyber offensive capabilities, 
both in order to enhance defense that the best way to get to 
the defensive stance I to be in the systems of those who are 
attacking us, and as a means to deter attack in the first 
place.
    And I think a major step was made when President Biden in 
his press conference in Geneva made very clear that we were 
prepared to use cyber-attacks in response to further attacks on 
the United States, particularly, the 16 critical infrastructure 
targets that are part of our own domestic guidelines.


Mr. Pfluger. Well, thank you very much for that.
    In my remaining 20 seconds, let me just say that I applaud 
Lithuania and their decision to leave the 17+1 cooperation 
framework over their concerns over the People's Republic of 
China's predatory and debt-trapping diplomacy that includes 
growing malign influence.
    I applaud it and I think that we as NATO, as a group, 
should continue to look for ways to counterbalance Chinese 
malign influence in addition to the Russian influence that we 
see.
    So with that, Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I 
appreciate everyone's service to this--to this organization and 
believe in NATO and its ability to stand up to the malign 
influence of actors around the world.",Addressing Emerging Security Challenges and NATO's Response to Cyber Threats,"The discussion highlights emerging security concerns, including aggression from China, Russia, and other malign actors, as well as asymmetrical threats like cyber-attacks, hybrid warfare, terrorism, and climate change. There is a focus on Russia's intensified cyber and disinformation campaigns targeting NATO member and partner states, and China's involvement in aiding transnational criminal activities. NATO's response involves considering China as a direct security challenge and developing strategies for collective defense, intelligence sharing, maritime coordination, and cyber defense. Additionally, there's an emphasis on the need for offensive cyber capabilities to enhance deterrence and response to cyber-attacks. The discussion underscores the importance of countering Chinese and Russian influence globally, including within NATO partnerships."

 According to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), 
the number of cybersecurity complaints to the IC3 in the last 4 
months has spiked from typically 1,000 daily before the 
pandemic to as many as 4,000 incidents a day.
    Furthermore, a survey conducted last month by VMware Carbon 
Black, one of our witnesses today, found that 80 percent of 
surveyed banks reported year-on-year increases in cyber attacks 
within the financial services sector. This year, those attacks 
have surged 238 percent from February to April.


Before I close, I would like to quickly touch on China and 
the threat to cybersecurity. The U.S. has been the target of 
cyber attacks from nation-states and nonstate actors for over 
20 years. But in the months of outbreak in the virus in the 
United States, cyber espionage from China, Russia, and Iran has 
spiked. Cyber threat actors are taking advantage of this crisis 
to attempt to undermine the U.S. Government and probe our 
systems in the private sector and public sector for weakness, 
and to stoke fear and division and confusion here at home.


 During the first 5 months of 2020 alone, cyber attacks 
against the financial sector have increased by 238 percent. 
This is compounded by the 900-percent increase in ransomware 
attacks. Cyber criminals are capitalizing on COVID-19, and they 
are doing so in tandem with the news cycle.


Criminals are increasingly sharing resources and 
information and reinvesting their illicit profits into the 
development of new and even more destructive capabilities. The 
cybercrime community has educated themselves as to the 
interdependencies that exist in the financial sector, and they 
have begun to commandeer these very interdependencies to 
manifest criminal conspiracies.


 In 2020, cybercrime conspiracies will become increasingly 
punitive and destructive. In fact, one out of four cyber 
attacks today are destructive.


First, any money laundering and forfeiture regulations must 
be modernized to seize the virtual currencies and digital 
payments which are used in cybercrime conspiracies.


  I want to note your leadership, Mr. Chairman, for calling 
out the very real threat of Iranian attacks on the United 
States, including on our financial infrastructure, for 
protecting our oil and natural gas pipeline infrastructure, and 
for fighting actively against overt and covert disinformation 
efforts online, including those that seek to divide us as a 
nation.


  We have seen attacks in Washington State, where the 
unemployment system has lost hundreds of millions of dollars in 
the post-COVID environment.
    And it isn't just here in the United States. In Germany, 
the state of North Rhine-Westphalia lost between $35 million to 
$110 million in fraudulent payments based on 3,000 fake 
requests in the post-COVID environment.


  Mr. Jaffer, are you concerned that China is a new and 
expanded threat in the cyber arena? In the past, we have 
frequently talked about North Korea, Iran, and Russia--Eastern 
European players, as we just noted. How do you think China 
compares to other countries when it comes to cyber attacks?
    Mr. Jaffer. Thank you, Congressman Hill.
    China is in the top rank of countries, if not number one of 
three, along with us and Russia,, in terms of cyber 
capabilities.


 The key issue that we see with China today, though, is what 
they are doing in terms of covert and overt misinformation and 
disinformation. They have taken a page right out of the 
Russians' playbook from 2016, and they are doubling down on 
that.
    We have seen the Chinese Foreign Ministry already talk 
about the Black Lives Matter movement. It is no accident that 
the Chinese are talking about that publicly. They are already 
putting a million of their own people in prisons in the 
Xinjiang province, and yet they are concerned about Americans.
    The reality is, they are not concerned about Americans. 
What they are concerned about is taking over a global 
leadership role from the United States, and they will use every 
means at their disposal to do it, including cyber activities, 
and that is what makes them particularly dangerous in this 
arena.
    Mr. Hill. Thank you.
    Do you see coordination between North Korea and their 
efforts in cyber attacks? Of course, they are some of the most 
famous with WannaCry of a few years ago and the Cosmos Bank 
scheme of just a few months, maybe a year or so ago. Do you see 
North Korea and China at all coordinating their efforts, or do 
you see North Korea purely on its own?
    Mr. Jaffer. I think North Korea generally acts on its own.


 Let me change the subject quickly to all of the panelists. 
Mr. Jaffer was speaking about disinformation. And I am curious 
if you all have seen efforts, whether it is Black Lives Matter 
or vaccines or whatever it might be, given the fact we are in 
this COVID-19 time in history, whether you have seen 
disinformation campaigns rise.
    And I will start--Mr. Kellermann, you are on my screen, so 
let's start with you, and then go to Mr. Jaffer.
    Mr. Kellermann. I think that our traditional Cold War 
adversaries are taking advantage of the situation. The American 
hegemony, the American empire you might want to call it, is the 
weakest we have ever been through a combination of factors.
    I explicitly don't see true evidence. I am not actually 
looking for it, because I assume it is happening, frankly, but 
I do see escalated cyber attack capabilities and activity 
occurring not just against the financial sector, but against 
the healthcare sector and a myriad of other sectors in this 
regard.


 Mr. Kellermann. Thank you.
    I have always been impressed, in my 20 years in 
cybersecurity, with the efforts of the Criminal Investigative 
Division (CID) of the Secret Service. They haven't been too 
flashy and taken too much credit for their successes, but they 
have done Herculean efforts as it relates to disrupting some of 
the most advanced cybercrime conspiracies in the world, 
beginning with the Eastern Europeans' cybercriminal syndicates 
back in the early 2000s.
    But they have always been underresourced, and they have 
always been stuck in this position where some of their very 
best analysts had to still provide for protection duty, which 
put a strain on even then keeping the best technological talent 
within their ranks.
    And this was compounded when they moved over to DHS post-9/
11. I understand why, but, at the same time, I think they could 
truly help us move the needle as it relates to civilizing 
American cyberspace and thwarting and suppressing some of the 
more advanced financial crime, cybercrime conspiracies that are 
ongoing if they were back in Treasury working hand-in-hand with 
FinCEN and others.


And then, lastly, when they come across an investigation 
where there is a cybercrime conspiracy and it is obvious there 
has been misuse of virtual currencies and alternative payment 
systems, those moneys could be used to fund their endeavors or 
fund the efforts to protect the financial sector from attack.


Mr. Kellermann. I wouldn't be an advocate of, let's say, 
shutting it down. I would just challenge the developers of 
these platforms to at least, when called upon, to know who your 
customer is when called upon, and to be able to freeze the 
assets associated with anything that has been proven to be part 
of a criminal or terrorist conspiracy using cyberspace.


 Mr. Gottheimer. One minute. So I will just say, as the 
world races to find a cure for COVID, Iranian and Chinese 
hackers have waged cyber attacks targeting American companies, 
universities, and research institutions, the pharmaceutical 
company Gilead Sciences, and the World Health Organization 
(WHO).


 Mr. Rose. Thank you.
    Cyber threat actors have been taking advantage of the 
crisis to undermine the U.S. Government, to prod systems for 
weaknesses, and stoke fear and confusion.
    Professor Jaffer, where are a majority of these cyber 
attacks originating from, and what has been their main target?
    Mr. Jaffer. Thank you, Congressman.
    Obviously, the vast majority of cyber attacks that come 
against our country are coming from a combination of nation-
states and fraudsters. So it depends on what we are talking 
about. If we are talking about major attacks on our banking 
system or the like, we have seen that come from countries like 
North Korea, and from Iran. We saw the 2016 and the 2012 
attacks on our banking system by Iran, and those continue 
apace.


 Chairwoman Waters. I would like to thank you for convening 
this hearing on the cybersecurity threats and electronic fraud 
issues that have proliferated during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Persistent cyber attacks on our financial system are not new. I 
don't know if you have had this discussion this morning, but I 
am concerned that some minority communities, and particularly 
those with higher limited-English-proficient populations, are 
more vulnerable to predatory practices and scams during the 
COVID-19 pandemic.


",Escalating Cybersecurity Threats Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a surge in cyber attacks and cybersecurity complaints, according to reports from the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) and a survey by VMware Carbon Black. Cyber attacks in the financial services sector alone have increased by 238 percent, with a 900-percent rise in ransomware attacks. Nation-states like China, Russia, and Iran are exploiting the crisis to launch cyber espionage campaigns, aiming to undermine U.S. government systems and instigate fear and division. Coordination between countries like North Korea and China remains a concern, although North Korea generally acts independently in cyber attacks. Witnesses stress the importance of modernizing money laundering regulations to seize illicit funds, enhancing resources for cybersecurity agencies, and holding virtual currency platforms accountable. Additionally, Chairwoman Waters highlights the vulnerabilities of minority communities, especially those with limited English proficiency, to predatory practices and scams during the pandemic."

 And there's a lot we can learn from what the Russians have 
been up to, including their overall information campaign, or 
disinformation campaign, their effort to tear down 
representative government in the West in general through a 
series of very low-cost options that are advancing their 
agenda. We need to really get in that game.


 No amount of hand-wringing here in Washington will appease 
them. We owe our allies and partners nothing less than our full 
and forceful support. That being said, we should also be candid 
with our allies as we are with our enemies. Projects like the 
Nord Stream 2 pipeline and NATO members' purchases of Russian 
military hardware amount to a huge economic, political, and 
propaganda victory for Putin.
    Our allies shouldn't be in the business of strengthening 
our adversaries. We should use a whole-of-government approach 
to address these issues before they become diplomatic pressure 
points.
    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses about how we 
can use diplomatic and military efforts to counter China's 
global ambitions in Europe. European nations are coming around 
to the threat of Chinese malign investment, hacking, and 
influence operations in their own backyard.
    We can use this opportunity to blunt China's advance, 
promote secure supply chains, and counter Chinese propaganda. 


 We live in an increasingly complex and contested world. 
Political uncertainty, energy competition, and diffusion of 
destructive technology are stressing the established, rules-
based international order. Threats and challengers seek to take 
advantage of these conditions through aggressive actions using 
all instruments of national power. And they're backed by 
increasingly capable military forces.
    Adversaries amplify these malign activities and foster 
instability with disinformation. Success in 21st century 
warfare demands we embrace competition and all of its 
associated activities below the level of armed conflict. This 
is actually as critical as preparations for crisis or conflict 
themselves.


 General Wolters. Chairman, if I could, with the assistance 
of this committee, we were able to kick off with SOCOM [U.S. 
Special Operations Command], our Special Operations Command 
Combatant Commander Operation Influence Platform. And 
underneath that architecture is what's called WebOps [web-based 
operations], and it's specifically designed to go after 
disinformation. And it's now a funded program with--with 
milestones set for future years.
    The Chairman. And what's--sorry to interrupt, but what's 
our message? I described what Russia's message is, but what's 
ours?
    General Wolters. Promote democratic values and tell the 
truth. And when disinformation is on the streets, highlight it.
    The Chairman. Thank you. Ms. Cooper.
    Ms. Cooper. Sorry, I would point to the election, the 2020 
election, as an example of Russia's aggressive disinformation 
efforts to divide and sow confusion and chaos in another 
population. It's a tactic that they've used in other places in 
the world, around Europe, and it hit home here in 2020. But we 
also saw it in our previous election.
    And at the national level, we are working to deter such 
actions in the future and to impose costs on Russia. And that 
is why today, actually, the Biden administration announced a 
number of sanctions on specific actors within Russia that were 
involved in election interference.


 Mr. Langevin. Yeah, it's essential to make sure that we're 
paying close attention to that so that our enemies and 
adversaries can't use that asymmetric advantage or capability 
against us.
    So let me just turn to something else. [Inaudible] cyber 
attack response [inaudible] coalition of partner nations is one 
of our most effective tools in deterring Russia, Russian cyber 
actions. Right now, our response speed has been in months and 
years, which is unacceptable, it's too slow.
    Ms. Cooper, what is your information-sharing relationship 
with the State Department regarding cyber attribution and how 
could we improve it more effectively this time?
    Ms. Cooper. Congressman, thank you. If I understood the 
question correctly, it relates to working in a whole-of-
government context on Russia cyber attribution. Is that 
correct, sir?
    Mr. Langevin. To shorten the window for attribution too. 
Identifying and responding, real quickly.
    Ms. Cooper. I see, thank you, sir. On this I can say we've 
actually come a long way. We still have a ways to go. Today we 
are attributing formally the SolarWinds cyber intrusion to 
Russia's SVR, their foreign intelligence service. That 
represents a public attribution that we are making in 
coordination with allies and partners who have also been 
affected by SolarWinds.


 Mrs. Hartzler. Thank you very much. Thank you to our 
witnesses. I'd like to cover questions about China and troop 
movements and Turkey. But I don't know if we'll have time for 
all of that. But I'll start off with General Wolters. You know, 
there's no question that Russia is our number one threat in 
Europe. They've shown time and again that they will invade a 
country and have malign influence. But while they're doing 
that, China also--it gives them an opportunity to expand their 
influence--their Belt and Road Initiative, their economic 
investments in the area. And I'm--really would like to get your 
feedback on what you're hearing from our European allies. First 
of all, do they recognize the threat of China? And what are 
their steps, or counter steps--are they taking? Do you see and 
do they see that 5G is a concern? And are--are the European 
allies concerned about the growing expansion and partnership 
with Russia in the Arctic and the Norwegian Sea? So a lot of 
questions there, but I'd appreciate your perspective.
    General Wolters. Congresswoman, first, the awareness of 
malign influence with respect to 5G, with respect to seaports, 
with respect to economic interest with aerial ports is--is 
markedly improving. I would have told you a year ago with 
respect to China, my number one concern was--was proliferation 
of 5G. What has happened over the course of the last year--5G 
with China Huawei and ZTE was--was spread into 15 separate 
nations. As a result of the U.K.'s position with 5G to reverse 
course and no longer go with China, other nations have followed 
suit. As we speak, 8 of those 15 nations have enacted 
restrictions against Huawei 5G and we're still working with the 
other 7.


 Ms. Strickland. Thank you, Chairman Smith. I would like to 
talk a bit about protecting service members and their families 
when they are deployed, especially given how the Kremlin and 
other adversaries are targeting them with misinformation and 
disinformation.
    So I understand that when service members are deployed in 
EUCOM's AOR, the Russian disinformation campaigns are 
especially interested in service members and their families. 
Can you discuss, as much as you can in this open setting, what 
EUCOM is doing to combat disinformation, how we are educating 
service members, and how we are improving their awareness of 
this possibility? Thank you.
    General Wolters. Thanks, Congresswoman. That is a great 
question. Again, we have instituted programs with the 
assistance of Special Operations Command that start at the very 
top of the strategic level to go after malign influence and 
misinformation to Active Duty members, reservists, guardsmen, 
and their dependents.
    The operations influence platform is specifically designed 
to target misinformation at the strategic and operational 
levels from Russia. And we have got a follow-on program called 
WebOps that takes it even further to make sure that there is a 
heightened awareness on behalf of all of the military members 
and the dependents in the EUCOM AOR about the malign influence 
from the information domain with respect to Russia.
    Ms. Strickland. Thank you. Ms. Cooper.
    Ms. Cooper. Well, I can just add to this at the strategic 
level in terms of the whole-of-government effort that we have 
to counter Russian disinformation. And actually, this is 
something that General Wolters plays a leadership role in 
because he is the co-chair with the State Department of the 
Russia Influence Group. And so even as we are dealing with 
these issues at the local level, at the installation level, at 
the individual level, at the strategic level our focus is on 
improving whole-of-government coordination to address Russia 
disinformation.


Mrs. Bice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The questions I have 
may be better served in the classified hearing, but I'll go 
ahead and just throw them out there now. I really want to hear, 
we've talked a lot about the F-35, and, certainly, I can maybe 
ask some additional questions, but I really would like to know 
about how you were battling the cyber issues that are happening 
with our adversaries, especially as it relates to what is 
happening in that part of the region.
    General Wolters. Congresswoman, I think the question had to 
do with malign influence on behalf of adversaries with respect 
to cyber; is that correct?
    Mrs. Bice. That is correct.
    General Wolters. I'll just start out by saying that the 
posture in Europe has improved significantly. As far as the 
organizations that we have, from a USEUCOM perspective, we have 
a Joint Cyber Center; I have an integrated planning element; 
and with my SACEUR [Supreme Allied Commander Europe] hat, I 
have a SHAPE [Supreme Headquarters Allied Partners Europe] 
Cyber Operations Center. And those three organizations come to 
a total of about 150 individuals.


 General Wolters. Georgia is a friend and key strategic partner of 
the U.S., strengthened by the Georgia National Guard's partnership, 
over 25 years strong. Years of deploying together side-by-side in Iraq 
and Afghanistan have only strengthened our mutual trust and respect. 
The Guard is instrumental in strengthening Georgia's capacity to train 
and operate with our Allies and Partners in exercises such as our Noble 
Partner and Allied spirit as well as in key areas like explosive 
ordnance disposal, cyber-security, and professional development. Future 
partnership activities will continue supporting bilateral efforts 
focused on enabling Georgia to effectively defend its territory, resist 
malign Russian influence, build interoperability with NATO forces, and 
institute defense reforms which further its Euro-Atlantic integration.


 Ms. Cooper. The Department regularly engages its allies and 
partners across Europe on the importance of securing sensitive supply 
chains, infrastructure, and technologies from undue influence by malign 
actors, which is critical for our collective security. We have seen 
progress among our European allies and partners, including strengthened 
laws and processes for foreign investment reviews, Memorandums of 
Understanding on 5G security, and other activities. The Department is 
eager to work with our European allies and partners to accelerate 
innovation and support the competitiveness of alternative suppliers. In 
addition, the Department supports focusing controls and restrictions on 
entities that further People's Republic of China (PRC)'s Military-Civil 
Fusion strategy and encourages publicly sharing information about these 
PRC entities with our European allies and partners.


 Mr. Moulton. Both the Kremlin and Beijing have subjected NATO 
allies to regular cyber attacks in an effort to undermine our alliance, 
and NATO's response thus far has clearly been insufficient to deter 
further malicious cyber activity. What steps do we need to take to 
modernize NATO in order to sufficiently address this threat to 
infrastructure, operations, IP, and information access and to ensure 
the relevance of the alliance in a contemporary security environment?
    Ms. Cooper. NATO recognizes that cyber threats to the Alliance are 
becoming more frequent and complex, disruptive, and coercive and that 
the Alliance must continue to adapt to the evolving cyber threat 
landscape. NATO has taken steps in recent years to recognize cyberspace 
as a domain of operations and to integrate cyber effects, provided 
voluntarily by allies, into Alliance operations and missions. Through 
the Cyber Defense Pledge, NATO Allies undertook to invest in better 
national cyber defenses, which will enhance deterrence through denial. 
In the recent case of the SolarWinds public attribution, NATO issued a 
statement of support for the United States in attributing this 
malicious cyber activity in order to promote accountability for those 
who carry out such actions. NATO is also in the process of updating its 
governance and cybersecurity procedures through a process known as 
``Cyber Adaptation'' to focus on cybersecurity responsibility and 
accountability. Finally, NATO is in the process of updating its 2014 
Enhanced Cyber Defense Policy to enable the Alliance to do more 
collectively to address malicious cyber activities.


 Mr. Moulton. I recently published an op-ed with Dr. Tammy Schultz 
in Time about the vulnerability of our troops to online disinformation, 
much of which stems from Russia, and its impacts on mission readiness, 
in particular the high rate of troops declining the COVID-19 vaccine. 
General Wolters, what are you doing to ensure that troops in USEUCOM 
are able to protect themselves from malicious disinformation, both in 
their ability to recognize information campaigns and ensuring personal 
discipline in what information they share online?
    General Wolters. USEUCOM Operations Security (OPSEC) program and 
annual training requirements provide cyber training and threat 
awareness and response training to enable members to protect themselves 
from potential adversaries and disinformation. USEUCOM, its components, 
and commanders at all levels use installation websites, direct email 
notification, commander led town-halls, social media engagements, and 
unit-led discussions to relay truthful COVID-19 information that is in 
line with both CDC and Department of Defense guidance. This ensures our 
service members and families have access to factual, evidence based 
scientific information to make informed decisions.
    Mr. Moulton. Both the Kremlin and Beijing have subjected NATO 
allies to regular cyber attacks in an effort to undermine our alliance, 
and NATO's response thus far has clearly been insufficient to deter 
further malicious cyber activity. What steps do we need to take to 
modernize NATO in order to sufficiently address this threat to 
infrastructure, operations, IP, and information access and to ensure 
the relevance of the alliance in a contemporary security environment?
    General Wolters. NATO continues to adapt to the evolving cyber 
threat landscape. In 2020, NATO released the Concept for the Deterrence 
and Defense of the Euro-Atlantic Area. To support this effort, NATO 
bolstered deterrence efforts in cyberspace by establishing a cyberspace 
operations center at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe in 
Mons, Belgium. Integrating cyber and information effects in joint U.S.-
NATO exercises enhances transparency and alignment and advances 
security cooperation. These combined efforts contribute to the 
Alliance's ability to address malicious cyber activity in a 21st 
century security environment.


 Ms. Cooper. Extremist violence/terrorism is not a new phenomenon in 
Europe and the United States, but increasing incidents are a cause for 
concern. Extremist movements have a long history, but now they have 
additional tools at their disposal--namely social media and the ability 
to propagate disinformation at a significant rate. The United States 
works very closely with European allies and partners to counter 
disinformation on a daily basis and regularly shares best practices via 
NATO and bilateral mechanisms. The United States also works to lead by 
example in addressing extremism within our own ranks, as evidenced by 
the Secretary of Defense directing a ``stand-down'' day to ensure a 
concerted effort to educate the military and civilian workforce about 
the scope of this problem and to develop sustainable ways to eliminate 
the corrosive effects that extremist ideology and conduct have on the 
workforce. During this ``stand-down,'' with the goal of recognizing and 
addressing extremism now and in the future, the Department reviewed 
issues such as the importance of our oath of office; identification of 
impermissible behaviors; and procedures for reporting suspected, or 
actual, extremist behaviors. Several European allies and partners 
sought information about curriculum used, and we will continue

Efforts to counter these threats involve whole-of-government approaches, diplomatic initiatives, and military strategies, including enhancing cyber defenses, promoting democratic values, and fostering information sharing among allies and partners. The focus is on strengthening alliances, improving awareness among service members, and modernizing defense mechanisms to effectively confront evolving security challenges in the digital age."

Whereas Islamophobia is actively being spread by a network of closely connected 
        and well-funded organizations and activists that seek to propagate

These entities spread misinformation about Arabs, Islam, and American Muslims, aiming to curtail the rights of religious minorities. The resolution seeks to condemn such actions and raise awareness about the harmful effects of Islamophobia. It underscores the importance of combating discrimination and promoting understanding and tolerance among communities. Overall, the resolution aims to counter the spread of misinformation and bigotry targeting Muslims and religious minorities."

 But Putin is not satisfied with repressing his own people 
at home. He seeks to export his tyranny and oppression abroad 
as an alternative authoritarian form of governance to 
democracy. This authoritarian world view best explains his 
aggressive foreign policy, based upon subverting democracy 
throughout the world through malign influence campaigns and 
redrawing borders with his aggressive assaults on democracy, 
such as Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine, with 12,000 Ukrainians 
who have been killed due to Russian aggression.


 Counter disinformation. The U.S. and Europe are better 
placed to deal with disinformation than in 2016, though the EU 
is ahead of us. We should work with social media companies to 
expose and limit Russian disinformation, support civil society 
groups, and prepare thoughtful regulation to support online 
transparency and integrity.


  In 2019, in Osaka, Trump and Putin laughed together about 
the evils of the independent media. Trump said, ``Get rid of 
them. 'Fake news' is great term, isn't it? You do not have this 
problem in Russia, but we do.'' Putin replied, ``We also have 
the same.''


 Third, Congress should enact new legislation to make Radio 
Free Europe/Radio Liberty an independent, nongovernmental 
organization with an independent board and a direct 
appropriation from the U.S. Congress. Doing so would be one 
more step of many others needed to counter Russian propaganda 
and disinformation.


    The Kremlin has set up a shadow security force, a private 
military organization known as the Wagner Group, and overseen 
by close Putin confidant Yevgeny Prigozhin, to carry out 
military actions, suppressive operations, and disinformation 
campaigns abroad. And Professor Kimberly Marten just spoke in 
detail about this organization.



",Countering Putin's Authoritarian Agenda,"This text highlights Putin's efforts to export authoritarianism abroad through aggressive foreign policies, disinformation campaigns, and support for repressive regimes. It emphasizes the need for the U.S. and Europe to counter Russian influence by exposing and limiting disinformation, supporting civil society groups, and enacting legislation to strengthen institutions like Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The text also mentions the creation of a shadow security force, the Wagner Group, to carry out military actions and disinformation campaigns on behalf of the Kremlin."

 Election officials are making decisions now that will 
govern how millions of Americans ultimately cast their ballot. 
During all of this confusion and uncertainty, the President is 
waging an insidious campaign to sow distrust by spreading false 
claims that vote-by-mail is ripe for fraud and threatening 
States that are expanding access to safe voting options.


These necessary changes and modifications to voting 
practices and election administration, coupled with the fear 
and confusion surrounding the COVID pandemic, creates 
circumstances that are ripe for disinformation and 
manipulation, and we have already seen our President contribute 
to that confusion with some of his tweets.
    So public education campaigns must also plan to combat 
disinformation. That is why we are gratified that the HEROES 
Act includes an additional $3.6 billion needed for States and 
local jurisdictions to implement measures that will facilitate 
accessible absentee voting and safe in-person voting. The Act 
also calls for the extension of early in-person voting, 
expanded online registration, and requires the removal of 
onerous conditions for absentee voting.


 You didn't get 83 ballots from those people. So I think 
that, at some point, we have to all do what is right for the 
people of this country, and we cannot continue to spread these 
misleading and false statements about this widespread fraud. It 
doesn't exist. You have no proof of it. You talk about it, and 
you have not one iota of proof to support it. You know, the 
Georgia thing--you know, in law, we have a saying that the 
thing speaks for itself, and the Georgia situation does speak 
for itself.


",Election Integrity and Disinformation Amid COVID-19,"Election officials are facing crucial decisions regarding voting procedures amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. However, President Trump's unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud via mail-in ballots are contributing to distrust and confusion. In response, the HEROES Act includes $3.6 billion to support safe voting options and combat disinformation. Meanwhile, critics argue that the allegations of fraud lack evidence, emphasizing the importance of accurate information in ensuring election integrity."

 Mr. Huizenga. Thanks, Madam Chairwoman. Advancements in 
technology have improved access to our capital markets and 
created new opportunities for countless Americans to 
participate in our markets who were previously excluded. App-
based interfaces, combined with zero commission trades, 
fractional share trading, and lowered account minimums, have 
ushered in a new generation of investors. However, instead of 
celebrating this new era of investment, how have my colleagues 
across the aisle responded for the most part? By falsely 
claiming that this increase in market participation has caused 
gamification in the experience, that markets are rigged, and 
some have even gone so far as to equating it to gambling in a 
casino.


 But sometimes, I am tempted to join in with my Grandpa on 
stuff. Going back to Mr. Scott's discussion with you earlier, I 
have to tell you, I do have a lot of concerns, and maybe it is 
just something I am going to have to learn to live with. But 
let me give you an example. The shares in Metro Bank in the UK, 
back in May, their shares fell over 10 percent before Metro 
could get control of the fake news about their financial free 
fall, and they are fortunate that it didn't go further.",Congressional Response to Market Accessibility and Technological Advancements,"Advancements in technology have democratized access to capital markets, enabling a broader spectrum of Americans to participate in investing. App-based platforms, zero commission trades, and fractional share trading have empowered a new generation of investors. However, instead of embracing this shift, some members of Congress have criticized increased market participation, alleging gamification and equating it to gambling. This perspective overlooks the positive impacts of technology on market accessibility and investor empowerment, highlighting a divide in congressional viewpoints regarding modern investment practices."

Dr. Roberts. Thank you so much and good afternoon, Chairman 
Clyburn, Ranking Member Scalise, and members of the 
subcommittee. I am Dr. Mysheika Roberts, the Health 
Commissioner here at Columbus Public Health, which serves the 
cities of Columbus and Worthington in the great state of Ohio.
    Over the past 20 months, my colleagues and I have worked 
tirelessly to keep our community safe during this once-in-a-
lifetime pandemic. Local health departments like mine are the 
boots on the ground, tasked with bringing this pandemic to an 
end in partnership with our state and Federal partners.
    The experience we bring to the table is unique. How public 
health is responding to this pandemic is no different than how 
we respond to other infectious diseases. While the scale is 
much larger, the work we do to mitigate and to protect the 
health is not new. Public health has been doing this work for 
nearly a century.
    Public health is essential to a thriving community. We need 
support to be successful, not only during this pandemic, but 
the new normal that lies beyond. We must be allowed to do what 
we do best, which is to protect our community's health using 
every public health tool at our disposal.
    After months of working really long hours on COVID-19 
testing, tracing, and vaccinating to protect the health of our 
community, my staff is burned out, overworked, and underpaid. 
Some are leaving the field entirely, unable to contribute any 
more to the work they once loved. Simply put, their tank is 
empty.
    The pandemic has taken its toll on all Americans, but its 
impact on public health is often overlooked, undervalued, and 
left in the shadows.
    Nearly all of my staff have been called to our COVID-19 
response. Many of them have jobs that have nothing to do with 
the infectious disease containment and mitigation of COVID-19. 
Yet, they are now on the front lines of this pandemic.
    Local health department staff are also combating 
unprecedented levels of disinformation that divides 
communities, it allows the virus to flourish, and it erodes the 
trust in the public health system.
    Public health officials also have been physically 
threatened and politically scapegoated, causing them to leave 
when they are needed the most.


Dr. Kanter, there continues to be a significant amount of 
misinformation regarding miracle cures for COVID. First, it was 
hydroxychloroquine, and now the miracle drug is the horse 
dewormer Ivermectin.
    Dr. Kanter, how is this misinformation and junk science 
impacting people in your state?
    Dr. Kanter. Thank you for the question, Representative 
Velazquez. And thanks for your work in this area, too.
    It's been incredibly harmful. And there is a long history 
of snake oil and snake oil salesmen in this country. And it is 
not just for this, COVID, it's not just hydroxychloroquine and 
Ivermectin. Talk about an antacid like Pepcid. I've seen people 
talk about gargling hydrogen peroxide, and all types of other 
things that do nothing to help prevent or treat COVID.
	 I'll tell you, what I've seen clinically and what I've 
heard from other clinicians is patients coming in sick with 
COVID and shocked and angry that the Ivermectin they were 
taking didn't help them, or the hydroxychloroquine they were 
taking didn't help them, and realizing too late that what they 
were listening to was not accurate.
    I think the essence here is we all wish that there was a 
silver bullet. I can't tell you how much I wish that there was 
a silver bullet that would be easy, one pill to make you 
immune. I wish that was true, and most doctors do. It's just 
not the case.
    And while some of these medicines might not hurt the person 
immediately, the harm they cause is in giving a false sense of 
security when there are other things, like vaccination, that 
would really protect them more.
    Ms. Velazquez. Thank you.
    There are people that know better. And when public 
officials do not immediately condemn the spread of 
misinformation or junk science, does it make your job harder to 
have the public follow public health guidance? And how does 
your agency try to combat misinformation?
    Dr. Kanter. It does. It makes the job more harder. But more 
important than that, it hurts people.
    I talk to a lot of individuals who have seen this 
misinformation on Facebook and social media, and believe it. 
And I would never fault anyone for that, because everything 
with COVID has been so fast paced and confusing, and that's 
understandable, and I have a lot of empathy for that.
    It's hard to have empathy for people that know better and 
are trying to spread this because God knows why. But they are 
trying to spread it. And there are real people and real 
families that get hurt on the other end of it. That's tough to 
stomach.


 Dr. McKenney. Yes, absolutely. Thank you for this question.
    For me, it has been a very personal experience. If you can 
imagine, I'm in my hometown where I grew up with all of these 
people, and I've been caring for them for over a decade.
    And those same people, as you mentioned about the 
misinformation and everything, these same people are ones that 
do attack and ask for your termination or your resignation. And 
these are people I've known for my whole life.
    So these are the things that truly hurt a community as a 
whole. It's not just the virus anymore, it's not just 
infection, it's not just physical health. But this leads to 
mental health problems, the misinformation, the problems when 
people are fighting in your community, when your community 
before the pandemic was so tight knit.
    And so, absolutely, not just in rural communities, we all 
have communities, whether it is urban, or our church community, 
or whatever it is. But all the misinformation, all the attacks 
on people just trying to help other people have really broken 
our society apart in so many ways that are beyond the virus and 
beyond infection.",Impact of Misinformation on Public Health during COVID-19,"Dr. Roberts, Health Commissioner at Columbus Public Health, highlighted the strain faced by local health departments during the pandemic, with staff experiencing burnout and challenges due to misinformation. Dr. Kanter discussed the harmful effects of misinformation, citing examples of misleading claims about COVID-19 treatments. Both emphasized the urgent need to combat misinformation to protect communities and ensure adherence to accurate public health guidance. Dr. McKenney emphasized how misinformation has fractured communities and exacerbated mental health issues. This testimony underscores the critical importance of addressing misinformation to effectively manage the ongoing pandemic."

This plan must ensure that research and development is 
rigorous, science-proven, and inclusive, and it must lay out 
specific standards, timelines, and milestones, a commitment to 
be fully transparent about the clinical trial data experts will 
use to evaluate safety and efficacy, and strategies for 
combating vaccine hesitancy and misinformation.


 For decades, CDC's public-private partnerships have safely 
distributed tens of millions of doses of routinely recommended vaccines 
to thousands of provider sites each year. CDC's experience shows the 
importance of strategic engagement across public and private components 
of the vaccine enterprise in a collaborative effort to ensure 
appropriate planning and coordination from development and 
manufacturing, to distribution, administration, and tracking. Early 
engagement and planning can help ensure quick and efficient bi-
directional exchange of information, so that everything needed to 
administer the vaccine, including personal protective equipment, is 
available where and when it is needed. And finally, the public must be 
well- informed, and misinformation must be addressed with timely, 
accurate, and trusted information.


I would also encourage you to talk frankly to the American 
people about what they can do to make themselves as safe as 
possible. It's been a lot of misinformation about social 
distancing and masks. I think the information has been pretty 
consistent about good hygiene, but you gentlemen and others 
have credibility and I would strongly encourage you to do that.


 Question. Dr. Redfield, what actions is HHS currently taking to 
address misleading and inaccurate information about vaccine safety?
    Answer. CDC's Vaccinate with Confidence framework aims to 
strengthen public trust in vaccines and prevent vaccine-preventable 
disease outbreaks. The framework emphasizes three key priorities: 
protect communities, empower families, and stop myths. CDC is working 
with local partners and using trusted messengers to establish new 
partnerships and contain the spread of misinformation. To advance this, 
we've recently collaborated with social media companies like Pinterest 
and Facebook to promote trustworthy information. To help protect them 
from misinformation, CDC seeks to reach new groups and stakeholders and 
provide clear information about vaccination and the critical role it 
plays in protecting the American public. CDC will continue to build 
upon the investments of our immunization program as it prepares both 
the Nation's public health system and the private sector to disseminate 
a COVID-19 vaccine once available.


  --Communications and Outreach: A strong and comprehensive 
        communication strategy is critical to any vaccine initiative. 
        Identifying the right messages, countering misinformation, and 
        targeted outreach to vulnerable and at-risk populations will be 
        necessary to achieve high coverage and herd immunity. CDC will 
        build on its existing relationships with public health partners 
        and health departments to effectively implement communication 
        efforts.


 Question. What steps is OWS taking now to educate the American 
public about a possible vaccination campaign? How is it ensuring that 
the American people have access to early, clear, and consistent 
information to make the best decisions about the health of their 
families?
    Answer. CDC recognizes that effective communication is a critical 
component of any vaccine program, and CDC is working collaboratively 
within Operation Warp Speed to ensure that consistent and accurate 
information is at the foundation of the communication plan currently 
being developed. Understanding that public confidence in vaccines is 
necessary for vaccine uptake, CDC's strategic framework, Vaccinate with 
Confidence (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-
confidence.html), aims to strengthen public trust in vaccines and 
prevent vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks. This framework 
emphasizes three key priorities: protect communities, empower families, 
and stop myths. Within this framework, CDC is working with local 
partners and using trusted messengers to establish new partnerships and 
contain the spread of misinformation. In addition to accurate 
communication of what we do and do not know, building confidence 
requires setting realistic expectations. CDC will continue to build 
upon the investments of our immunization program as the agency works 
with both the Nation's public health system and the private sector to 
plan and prepare for dissemination of a COVID-19 vaccine, once 
available.


Question. What work is underway on a national vaccine campaign? 
Once a vaccine is approved, how can we ensure that the public feels 
confident in the safety of the vaccine? What strategies will CDC employ 
to ensure that vulnerable communities, such as minority communities--
who have been hit hardest by COVID-19 and historically have lower 
immunization rates--get the vaccine? How will CDC work to combat 
misinformation about a COVID-19 vaccine and vaccines more broadly to 
increase confidence in a vaccine and therefore increase vaccination 
rates?
    Answer. CDC recognizes that effective communication is a critical 
component of any vaccine program, and CDC is working collaboratively 
within OWS to ensure that consistent and accurate information is at the 
foundation of the communication plan currently being developed. 
Understanding that public confidence in vaccines is necessary for 
vaccine uptake, CDC's Vaccinate with Confidence (https://www.cdc.gov/
vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html) strategic framework 
emphasizes protecting communities, empowering families, and stopping 
myths.


--Stopping Myths: CDC will work with social media companies to 
        promote trustworthy vaccine information, provide accurate and 
        accessible information to policy makers, and engage State and 
        local health officials to advance effective local responses to 
        misinformation


 --Engaging State and local health officials to advance effective 
        local response to misinformation and bring attention to 
        credible resources


 Answer. A strong and comprehensive communication strategy is 
critical to any vaccine initiative. Identifying the right messages, 
countering misinformation, and targeting outreach to vulnerable and at-
risk populations will be necessary to achieve high coverage and herd 
immunity. CDC will build on its existing relationships with local 
public health partners and health departments to effectively implement 
communication efforts. CDC is also convening a critical populations 
workgroup to work on innovative approaches to vaccinate hard to reach 
populations.
    Question. Some of your agencies have extensive ad budgets. Would 
you commit--where possible--to increasing advertising in local 
newspapers and broadcast stations to ensure they are able to 
disseminate important information and continue to operate throughout 
the pandemic?
    Answer. A strong and comprehensive communication strategy is 
critical to the COVID-19 public health response. Identifying the right 
messages, countering misinformation, and targeting outreach to 
vulnerable and at-risk populations are important elements of CDC's 
approach. CDC has made available a variety of communication resources 
including public service announcements, social media and communications 
materials, posted online (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/
communication/index.html). CDC has collaborated with an advertising 
campaign that has been organized by the Ad Council (www.adcouncil.org). 
The Ad Council has developed public service ads, social media assets 
and more that has been seen in media around the nation since February. 
The entire campaign has aired utilizing donated media and digital 
platform time and space. The Ad Council has a number of ads and other 
assets that are available free to media to take and use http://
coronavirus.adcouncilkit.org/.



",Ensuring Transparency and Combatting Vaccine Misinformation,"This text emphasizes the importance of rigorous research and development, transparency, and combatting vaccine misinformation in the planning and execution of a COVID-19 vaccination campaign.

 For over 30 years, both the U.S. and-Israel have benefitted from 
joint military training exercises and joint research and development 
against common threats-from high-end weapons and cyber-attacks to 
improvised explosive device (IEDs) and terrorist tunnels. Twice each 
year, U.S. Marines conduct desert warfare training with their IDF 
counterparts, and American soldiers and security officials regularly 
visit Israel to study its approach to urban combat. U.S. pilots hold 
simulated combat training with the Israeli Air Force. In addition, 
Israel and the United States have cooperated on a wide range of 
intelligence-sharing programs, including monitoring Iran, Syria, al-
Qaeda, and other terrorist groups and sponsors. In the biennial Juniper 
Cobra exercise, U.S. and Israeli forces practice an integrated defense 
to counter the growing threat from ballistic missiles and long-range 
rockets. Given a U.S. desire to reduce overseas commitments, Israel's 
role as a reliable ally in a critical region is more important than 
ever.


 Between the global pandemic, rising nationalism, challenges to 
democracy, climate change, increasing distrust between people, and the 
weaponization of disinformation, it is more important than ever to 
acknowledge the value of exchange programs in supporting national 
security. This educational and cultural exchange programs appropriation 
would help further our foreign policy objectives through more 
initiatives like the following: a youth program connecting U.S. 
community colleges with peers in Jordanian and Iraqi institutions to 
co-develop solutions for sustainability challenges faced by businesses; 
the 2020 Elections Virtual Reporting Tour which convened 214 
journalists from 114 different countries and enabled international 
journalists to generate more than 1,200 media products with credible 
reporting; and, a Virtual Alumni Reunion of the Pan-Africa Youth 
Leadership Program (PAYLP) which engaged over 300 participants from 30 
countries across sub-Saharan Africa and encouraged participants to 
recommit themselves to their community.


 Turkey.--Turkey continues to demonstrate it is not a true and 
dependable U.S. and NATO ally. The U.S. government, both executive and 
legislative branches, rightly sanctioned Turkey for its procurement of 
the Russian-made S-400 missile defense system under Countering 
America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) in December 2020. 
Those penalties should be expanded. AHI calls for the continued 
inclusion of appropriations language that direct the suspension of 
delivery or transfer of F-35 aircraft to Turkey until reports detailing 
the impact of Turkey's purchase of the S-400 missile system from Russia 
on U.S. weapon systems such as the F-35s are provided to Congress. In 
addition, Turkey's support for Hamas has been evident. President 
Erdogan has hosted Hamas' top leadership, including individuals 
designated as global terrorists. Hamas' recent attack against U.S. ally 
Israel only further highlights Turkey's role as a malign regional 
influence.


Prepared Statement of The Asia Foundation (TAF)
Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham & Members of the Subcommittee:

    I am honored to submit this testimony as President of The Asia 
Foundation (TAF). We are deeply grateful for the confidence the 
Committee has shown in the Foundation. For 67 years, the Asia 
Foundation has advanced the interests of the United States in 
supporting stable democracies, good governance, the political and 
economic rights of women, climate action and free markets in the Indo-
Pacific. Established in 1954, The Asia Foundation is a private, non-
profit, nongovernmental organization headquartered in San Francisco. An 
annual appropriation is authorized under The Asia Foundation Act of 
1983 (22USC4402). The Act acknowledged the importance of sustained 
funding for TAF and endorsed its ongoing value and contributions to 
U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific. We pledge to you that with your 
continuing support, the Asia Foundation will sustain its work across 
the Indo-Pacific. In order to build on Congress' investment in the 
Foundation, The Asia Foundation is asking for $20,000,000 for Fiscal 
Year 2022, the same level as enacted in FY2021 and consistent with the 
President's FY2022 request. During the COVID-19 pandemic,TAF's work 
with governments and local communities proved to be more in demand than 
ever. The flexibility of appropriated funding has made it possible to 
immediately address needs identified by partners, including combatting 
the upsurge in gender based violence, public information campaigns on 
Covid-19 with government and civil society groups to address 
misinformation and disinformation efforts, and planning for economic 
re-birth for many communities affected by unemployment, economic 
displacement, challenges to inclusion and other consequences of the 
pandemic. During the crisis, most importantly, TAF has found ways to 
maintain its ongoing programs and have impact.
    In FY2022, TAF will expand new technology driven programs to expand 
economic empowerment, and address the future of work in the region, 
particularly as it affects women. TAF will also increase its program 
activities in Pacific Island nations important to U.S. interests, to 
bolster democratic institutions, address disinformation in a post-Covid 
period, build civil society and expand opportunities for women. TAF 
will also expand climate resilience initiatives in one of the most 
vulnerable regions of the world.


  In many low- and middle-income countries, too few students arrive 
at primary school on track developmentally and ready to learn. An 
estimated 250 million children globally fail to meet their 
developmental milestones,\13\ meaning nearly one-third of the world's 
children are entering elementary grades without the cognitive, social-
emotional, motor, and language skills they need to fulfill their 
potential. U.S. foreign assistance needs to expand programs that 
improve early childhood care and education, including pre-primary 
education and multi-sectoral early childhood development interventions 
for children ages 0-8. While inclusion of children with disabilities 
and marginalized populations is essential to quality education at all 
levels, it is especially important during the early years, as they are 
the foundation and gateway to fruitful, lifelong learning.
    Children need additional support to make the transition from 
primary to secondary school so that the growing youth population has 
the opportunity for gainful employment and personal achievement.\14\ 
Higher-level skills that are acquired in secondary school should 
prepare students for participation in the fast-paced, rapidly changing 
global economy. Automated technologies will continue to replace low-
skilled labor and employers will increasingly demand technical, social, 
and critical-thinking skills. Digital literacy and information 
engagement skills, including the ability to identify misinformation, 
build emotional resilience to it, and reflect on one's own information 
consumption, will be needed for the positive development of children 
and youth moving forward.


Countering Malign Chinese Influence
    The State Department's CWD program helps counter Chinese influence 
by providing local jobs and serving as a highly visible form of popular 
U.S. assistance. While China uses debt trap financing to seize control 
of national assets in Africa, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere, US 
demining programs work in these same regions to take land that is 
currently too dangerous to use and transform it into an economic asset 
available to impoverished local populations. Every day, thousands of 
deminers with U.S. flags on their chests provide an unquestionably 
positive service to communities.


 Increased funding of $30 million would support up to 1,000 
additional grant opportunities, to engage more Americans, more U.S. 
colleges and universities, and more diverse communities at a time when 
re-engagement with the post-pandemic world is critical. Over the past 
year, the number of applicants for both the U.S. Student and Scholar 
Programs has increased by more than 10%. A funding increase of roughly 
10% could help meet this pent-up demand and enable Fulbright to expand 
into priority areas.
    Additional funding would allow the U.S. to build upon proven models 
of the Fulbright Program to address pressing issues like climate 
change, democracy building, and countering disinformation and undue 
foreign influence. The Program operates where others cannot, fostering 
goodwill toward America, and establishing a scholarly network where 
research and development can flourish.


 Increased funding for Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance is 
critical to ensure countries are equipped to handle the challenges of 
maintaining sustained development, particularly with marginalized 
groups in light of COVID-19. Without strong political institutions and 
governments responsive to its citizens' needs, efforts to maintain 
other areas of development and growth of civil society are at a greater 
risk of failure. On average, countries undertaking the process of 
democratization experience a 20% increase in GDP over a 25-year period. 
In addition, democracy can better ensure the rights and participation 
of largely disenfranchised groups within society--critical as countries 
adapt to climate change. The condition of human rights and democracy 
has worsened in 80 countries since the pandemic began. In the wake of 
COVID-19, disinformation can spread, crackdowns on civil society have 
persisted, democratic backsliding increased, and autocratically minded 
leaders continue to undermine democratic norms.


 independent media as a centerpiece of foreign assistance
    Accurate information, delivered by trusted local media, is key to 
engaging citizens to heed public health guidance, debunk disinformation 
and misinformation, take action on climate change, and participate in 
democratic governance:

  --COVID-19 & Global Health: Information is the first line of defense 
        against the spread of communicable diseases such as COVID-19. 
        It is essential that complex, life-saving information, which is 
        overwhelmingly produced in English, be interpreted and 
        localized by science-savvy local journalists in all corners of 
        the world. To address misinformation that undermines public 
        health directives and vaccination efforts, research 
        demonstrates the critical importance of proactively 
        communicating accurate information through local media, which 
        command trust in their communities.
  --Internet Freedom: Unfettered access to an open, interoperable, 
        secure, and reliable internet is essential to economic 
        development, civic participation, health, and education. While 
        60% of the world's population is now online, anti-democratic 
        regimes continue to restrict access to quell political 
        opposition. Greater support is needed to bring digital 
        connectivity to all corners of the globe, ensure online safety 
        for women and other marginalized groups, and protect human 
        rights online.
  --Disinformation & Misinformation: Misinformation about COVID-19 and 
        vaccines undermine efforts to bring the pandemic under control. 
        Disinformation from bad actors undercuts the legitimacy of 
        elections, pollutes civic debate, and stokes violence offline. 
        A comprehensive strategy to address disinformation and 
        misinformation requires a three-pronged approach: ensure the 
        production and free flow of quality information; empower 
        citizens with media literacy skills to recognize falsehoods; 
        and establish stronger accountability mechanisms for those who 
        create, propagate, or amplify disinformation.


oversight of usaid's covid-19 response
    The COVID-19 pandemic poses a significant public health crisis. 
More than a year after its emergence-and in the wake of 169 million 
confirmed cases and almost 3.5 million deaths as of the end of May 
2021-COVID-19 has disrupted economies, strained democratic 
institutions, and deepened existing humanitarian crises. The pandemic 
also emerged in an international environment marked by increasing great 
power competition and disinformation campaigns by hostile actors.


 --Information Management. USAID depends on information systems for 
        all facets of business. Our audit of USAID's Development 
        Information Solution system found that although USAID was 
        making progress in the development and implementation of the 
        system, its deployment was behind schedule and not on track to 
        provide the Agency with advanced reporting to improve evidence-
        based decision making.\27\ In addition, in the past year, the 
        Agency's expanded use of telework to protect the health and 
        safety of staff during the pandemic has increased risks to the 
        Agency's information systems and calls for additional 
        diligence. In June 2020, USAID's Chief Information Officer 
        reported a 400 percent increase in cyberattacks on the Agency 
        since the start of the pandemic. Our most recent audit of 
        USAID's information security program identified needed 
        improvements in risk management, configuration, and identity 
        and access management; security training; information security 
        continuous monitoring; and contingency planning.\28\",The Importance of U.S.-Israel Military Cooperation and Cultural Exchange Programs,"The text highlights the longstanding military and intelligence cooperation between the U.S. and Israel, which has helped counter common threats for over 30 years, and the importance of educational and cultural exchange programs in supporting foreign policy objectives and addressing global challenges like the pandemic, nationalism, threats to democracy, climate change, and disinformation. Given the U.S. desire to reduce overseas commitments, Israel's role as a reliable ally in a critical region is more important than ever, and these exchange programs are crucial in the face of such pressing issues."

 President Biden promised his administration would follow 
science and truth. Director Walensky said the guidance was free 
from medical meddling. A paper trail shows this to be patently 
false. Biden's Secretary of Education said, quote, ``In-person 
learning offers our young people the best opportunity,'' end 
quote. Why not listen to him?
    The Democrats and the teachers' union kept schools closed, 
and now not only has a generation of young children been robbed 
of a year of education, but mental health problems are up 31 
percent, drug use and addiction resulting in overdose have 
exploded, and children as young as 9 have committed suicide, 
all traced back to the shuttering of schools. Now we know who 
is responsible, the teachers' union. Union involvement in the 
drafting and editing of scientific guidance is the very 
definition of political meddling. It is unclear how many 
children were locked out of school because of the union's 
selfishness, and even today, summer camps don't have guidance 
from the CDC on reopening without masks. Do they need to hire 
the AFT?


 Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Well, I think it is interesting that in 
2007, melamine pet food from China caused dogs to die and had 
to be removed. In 2008, in July 2008, milk and baby formula was 
deliberately adulterated with melamine in order to pass quality 
control measures. Babies were harmed. In October, similar 
adulteration to eggs; in 2012, sweet potato dog treats from 
China causing kidney failure; and in June 2020, manufacturers 
in China charged with three counts of violating FDCA for 
misbranded, substandard respirator masks, falsely purported to 
be N95 standard. The FBI said this was a blatant disregard for 
the safety of American citizens.
    And on March 7 of this year, 2021, The Wall Street Journal, 
``U.S. officials at the State Department indicated Russian 
intelligence agencies have mounted disinformation campaigns to 
undermine confidence in the Pfizer and other vaccines.''",Allegations of Political Interference in School Reopenings and Health Guidance,"This testimony raises concerns about the impact of political influence, particularly from teachers' unions, on school reopenings and health guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic. The speaker criticizes the Democratic Party and teachers' unions for keeping schools closed, attributing negative consequences such as mental health issues, drug use, and youth suicides to prolonged closures. The involvement of unions in shaping scientific guidance is deemed as political meddling. Additionally, the testimony highlights broader issues of product safety and vaccine misinformation campaigns originating from China and Russia, respectively."

 SENATOR PATTY MURRAY

    Senator Murray. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Dr. 
Stone, Dr. Kim, welcome, and I appreciate you being here with 
us today.
    I want to start on the topic of how we promote vaccine 
confidence and fight disinformation and misinformation that can 
lead to vaccine hesitancy. We are seeing misinformation about 
vaccines spread really easily and widely across the internet, 
including through social media and messaging apps, coming from 
all kinds of sources and targeted to all kinds of people. And a 
lot of discussion around misinformation has been around 
communities of color. But we know that disinformation is a 
serious concern among all demographics. That can lead to our 
veterans, caregivers, family members refusing a vaccine, even 
when they are offered one.
    So I wanted to ask you, how is the VA and its Federal 
partners tackling this disinformation targeting all groups of 
veterans?


 SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL

    Senator Blumenthal. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I apologize if I 
cover ground you have already done, but I first want to say how 
proud I am to know that Connecticut, really, I think it is at 
the forefront of these efforts to vaccinate veterans. In 
Connecticut, 47 percent of our veterans have received a first 
dose, and 23 percent a second dose, which is far ahead of the 
national average. I am also pleased to say that 77 percent of 
our veteran employees have been vaccinated, and so they are 
protected.
    I think that this kind of record is due to real leadership. 
Obviously, you are trying to inspire that kind of leadership at 
the national level. But we need more aggressive leadership at 
the local level to counter the kind of misinformation and 
hesitancy that is found among certain populations, and, as 
well, to provide vaccinations to caregivers and spouses, family 
members, who live with our veterans, because I think one of the 
reasons why veterans may not come for a vaccine is that their 
spouse or caregiver is not going to get it as well, and either 
because they depend on that person for transportation and 
advice or for some other reason, they may be hesitant.",Addressing Vaccine Hesitancy and Disinformation Among Veterans,Senators Patty Murray and Richard Blumenthal discuss the importance of promoting vaccine confidence and combating misinformation targeting veterans. They highlight efforts by the VA and its federal partners to address vaccine hesitancy across all demographic groups. Senator Blumenthal praises Connecticut's success in vaccinating veterans and emphasizes the need for aggressive leadership at the local level to counter misinformation and ensure vaccination access for caregivers and family members.

 Let us not forget that the Chinese Communist Party silenced 
doctors, hid the virus until it was too late, and tried to 
cutoff PPE from reaching European and American markets. It 
bears repeating again. Additionally, the CCP has tried to 
strain the U.S.-EU relationship through disinformation 
campaigns. Luckily, last month, the EU Commission finally 
acknowledged the threat posed by the communist regime.


 Second, the U.S. and Europe should cooperate to provide 
reliable information to our citizens during the pandemic. Facts 
may be stubborn things, but the World Health Organization has 
warned about an ``infodemic'' of false information about the 
coronavirus.
    GMF analyzed outlets sharing false content and developed a 
policy roadmap on how to combat the ``infodemic.'' It is useful 
not only for U.S. policymakers but also as a basis for a 
transatlantic policy dialog given the shared interest in 
safeguarding the information ecosystem.
    GMF's Alliance for Securing Democracy is tracking Chinese 
and Russian State-based messaging, which shows how the pandemic 
has spawned an epidemic of online disinformation. Congress has 
a key role to play on drafting legislation to combat 
disinformation, and we can learn valuable lessons on how Europe 
is responding.
    One important arrow in our quiver to combat both 
misinformation and disinformation has been the federally funded 
media entities, including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 
overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media. The Agency's new 
CEO set off a firestorm of controversy when he immediately took 
action to fire top executives and remove the boards of the 
constituent entities last month. In Congress, bipartisan 
concern has been expressed in both chambers, including by this 
committee.


 Meanwhile, security and defense challenges have not 
subsided. NATO has seen an uptick in cyber attacks and 
disinformation during the pandemic. Early in the pandemic, 
Russian media falsely suggested that a British facility created 
the coronavirus and deliberately planted it in China. 
Subsequent disinformation efforts blamed the source of the 
outbreak on U.S. and European elites and its spread on the U.S. 
military. Since January, the EU's External Action Service has 
logged more than 110 cases of Russian disinformation.


 Finally, a note on China. The pandemic has moved Europe 
closer to the U.S. view on China. Moreover, disinformation 
efforts by China to cover up and deflect blame for the pandemic 
have exposed its authoritarian tactics and raised questions 
about its motives. The recent U.K. decision to reduce Huawei's 
access to the U.K. market may be a reflection of this.


  I think, fortunately, in terms of military cooperation, 
both bilaterally and within a NATO context, the U.S. does 
continue to lead. The European Deterrence Initiative is alive 
and well, and NATO allies are stepping up to revise the command 
structure and adapt the alliance to take into consideration 
things like the growing threat from China and disinformation. 
So I think we are on a good track there, but we just need to 
stick together.


  Dr. Carafano, how effectively are our European partners 
pushing back on the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda 
campaign and sharing the truth of the CCP's egregious 
mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak? Do you anticipate that 
European countries will be more willing to oppose Chinese 
predatory investment practices and push to control 
international organizations?


I am concerned about Beijing's mishandling of the COVID-19, 
the CCP subsequent disinformation campaign. And how can the 
U.S. stress to its European allies and partners the need to 
take the threat from Beijing more seriously. You know, I was 
glad the UK did not get in--on the Huawei with their 5G, and 
they got off that. And so I will just ask, and I quit. Any of 
you all can jump in.


 And I think one of the areas you mentioned, disinformation, 
is a terrific example of an area where Americans and Europeans 
have exactly the same assessment of the extent to which we are 
seeing Chinese disinformation throughout our societies, both 
trying to deepen the divisions in our societies and even affect 
elections. I think these are vital areas for the U.S. and 
Europe to cooperate on in standing up to China.


 I think one great initiative would be great to see a NATO 
center of excellence that looks at some of the aspects of 
Chinese competition, including disinformation and economic 
activity. I think that would be really useful for NATO.
    Ms. Ellehuus. Hi there. I would just like to add a point on 
our approach to Europeans now that they are moving closer to 
our position. I think, you know, if you go back 3 or 4 years, 
you see that the U.S. was equally trying to have a good 
economic relationship with China and look aside against some of 
the security interests.
    I think we can really influence EU legislation on foreign 
direct investments. They are already standing up the process, 
very similar to our CFIUS vetting. I think shining a light on 
the disinformation is important.
    Increasingly, what we have seen in this COVID crisis is 
China taking a page from the Russian playbook in terms of how 
they execute disinformation. Before, it was about image 
improvement for China. Increasingly, it is about undermining 
Western democracies. And so we can work with European countries 
to compare notes and tailor our response accordingly.


 Ms. Donfried, I wonder if you could speak some about the 
disinformation campaigns and how it has affected both the U.S. 
and European COVID response plans, and I am, you know, 
particularly interested in the role of China in both engaging 
in and really actively spreading disinformation, and how we 
might be working better with our U.S.--European partners to 
respond to disinformation related to COVID-19, what we should 
be doing with our social media platforms in partnership with 
the European Union. But we have seen examples in this country 
of widespread dissemination of misinformation that is likely 
causing the death of Americans and obviously people around the 
world, and it seems to me this is a place of a real opportunity 
to partner closely with our allies. I would love to know your 
thoughts on that.
    Dr. Donfried. Thank you so much for the question. I want to 
give a shout-out to some of my colleagues with GMF's Alliance 
for Securing Democracy, who have been looking very closely at 
the disinformation space. They literally track the messaging 
that is coming from Chinese and Russian State-backed media, and 
recently have added Iran to that mix as well.
    The fascinating thing is that you see these State actors 
not only spreading misinformation. There is some of that, and 
that is deeply disturbing, but they are also trying to deepen 
the fault lines in the U.S., for example, between people who 
believe in vaccinations and anti-vaxxers. They are trying to 
deepen those divides within the country and are very skillfully 
using disinformation to do that.
	 I think the first thing is to understand what these actors 
are doing and shine a spotlight on it, because transparency is 
a good reaction to it. But then we also need to think about how 
we defend ourselves better against it, and I am happy to share 
with you some of the policy recommendations we have proposed.
    We also believe that this is an area where the U.S. and 
Europe can work very effectively together, because our European 
allies see the same thing and are concerned about it. We have 
seen the European Parliament establish a special committee on 
foreign interference, and they will be producing a report 
within a year. The European Commission has been very active in 
the space.
    I do think that together we can be even more effective not 
only in exposing those disinformation campaigns, but in putting 
in place policies that allow us to stand up to it.",Addressing Disinformation and Chinese Influence: Transatlantic Cooperation in the Face of COVID-19,"The text discusses the Chinese Communist Party's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its silencing of doctors and dissemination of disinformation. It emphasizes the need for the U.S. and Europe to cooperate in combating the ""infodemic"" of false information about the virus. The role of organizations like the German Marshall Fund (GMF) and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty is highlighted in tracking and countering disinformation. There is a call for bipartisan legislative action to combat disinformation and for NATO to establish a center of excellence on Chinese competition. European countries are seen as moving closer to the U.S. position on China, providing opportunities for cooperation on issues like foreign investments and disinformation. Transatlantic coordination is viewed as essential in responding to Chinese and Russian disinformation campaigns, with the European Union playing a key role in implementing policies to counter disinformation."

 I am also very glad that we have this chance to talk with 
Jamie Fly, President and CEO of Radio Free Europe/Radio 
Liberty, about the media situation in Belarus. Jamie is an 
expert in European affairs, human rights, global media, and 
disinformation campaigns by global adversaries. In addition, he 
is no stranger to our committee, having served as national 
security advisor to Senator Rubio for more than 4 years.
    There have long been restrictions on the press in Belarus, 
but Lukashenka has recently tightened his grip and grown bolder 
in his crackdown on press organizations and independent 
journalists who seek to hold him accountable. Lukashenka's 
Government has passed Draconian laws aimed at silencing the 
populace. Journalists have had their offices and homes raided 
and have been arrested, tortured, and even killed. Several RFE/
RL journalists are in Lukashenka's prisons.


 It is important to remember that in the lead-up to the 
Ryanair diversion, there were several significant events in the 
week before that, including the closure of the largest in-
country independent media, Tut.by. So this target is very 
clear.
    I think there is more for us to do in support of that 
independent media. I think the Global Engagement Center's work, 
if I could tout that for a second, is absolutely essential in 
terms of how we counter some of the massive amounts of 
disinformation that are at work in the Belarus account. Again, 
I know that Jamie Fly will talk much more about what it is that 
RFE/RL can do, and I am quite supportive of that.


 I briefly wanted to note Russia's support for Lukashenka's 
efforts to control the information space. In the early months 
of the protests, at Lukashenka's request, the Kremlin sent 
Russian propagandists from Russian state TV to assist the 
Belarus state TV channels because many of those journalists at 
Belarus state TV started to resign from their jobs. At the same 
moment the Kremlin was doing this, RFE/RL sought to provide an 
alternative to Russian disinformation in Belarus, and we sent 
some of our own Russian-based journalists to cover the events 
in Belarus for a very interested Russian public until those 
journalists from Russia, like other foreign journalists, were 
kicked out by the Belarusian Government.


 Lukashenka has clearly long admired the Russian Government's 
approach to propaganda. After employees resigned in protest from 
Belarus state-controlled TV stations in the early months of the post-
election protests, at Lukashenka's request, Russian state-controlled 
media outlets sent staff to assist Belarus State TV channels, which 
then started sounding eerily similar to their Russian counterparts. 
While Russian state media sent propagandists to lie to Belarusians 
about what was happening in their country, RFE/RL sought to provide an 
alternative to Russian disinformation. We sent some of our Russia-based 
journalists to cover the events in Belarus for a very interested 
Russian public until they, along with other foreign journalists, were 
kicked out by the Belarusian Government.


Even as independent media outlets, including RFE/RL, are being 
threatened as never before across this vital region, Russia and China 
are expanding their information operations across our broadcast area 
and investing significant resources. Our work in many languages 
provides an alternative to their state-controlled narratives in 
countries and pushes back on misinformation using facts and live 
footage that show first-hand the truth about what is happening on the 
ground in Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, Central Asia, and the 
Balkans. Meeting this challenge will require sustained investment at a 
time when our competitors are committing significant resources.
    RFE/RL needs ongoing support from Congress to ensure that our 
editorial independence and that of our fellow congressionally funded 
broadcast networks is respected and protected. That independence is 
codified in the International Broadcasting Act but turmoil over the 
last year at the U.S. Agency for Global Media has raised concerns 
amongst some of our audiences and our journalists about the limitations 
of these protections.
    Most of our journalists are in-country locals, working to provide 
journalism as an essential service for their communities. They are 
patriotic citizens of their countries, working side by side with our 
audiences and facing hostile governments that try to paint them as 
intelligence operatives or agents of a foreign power. While the early 
months of the Biden administration have led to reassuring moves by the 
Acting leadership of the Agency to reaffirm our editorial independence, 
it is important for Congress to continue to make clear that you fund 
our journalism not because of a desire to spread U.S. propaganda to the 
world but because you understand the important role that a free press 
plays in the functioning of democracy.


 Mr. Fly. Thank you for that question, Senator Shaheen. I 
just want to thank you in particular, and Senator Murphy and 
Senator Portman, because the visit that you held with our 
journalists in Kiev was not just a strong symbol of support to 
them and those who have recently had to leave Moscow. When you 
speak out in that way on their behalf, it is noticed by all of 
our journalists, and I think journalists who do not even work 
for RFE/RL, and gives them more courage to do their job. So 
thank you for taking your time during your visit to Kiev.
    My concern is that we see this trend in Russia, we see it 
in Belarus at differing rates, of criminalization of 
journalism, authoritarians trying to control the information 
space, limit the options for their citizens to state propaganda 
outlets or outlets that the regime is comfortable allowing 
because they are non-controversial. We are seeing that in 
different forms, at different speeds, but we are seeing them 
learn from each other and adapt their approaches.


 Mrs. Tsikhanouskaya. At the moment, the Kremlin supports 
Lukashenka politically and financially somehow. We want 
friendly relations with all the countries, including Russia, 
and propaganda is trying to show us that we are against Russia, 
but this is not true. We are against dictatorship, and it 
depends on the Belarusians when they will choose in free and 
fair elections.


Mr. Fly. Thanks for that question. I have had these 
conversations with Russian officials in the past when I visited 
Moscow a bit over a year ago, and my response to them was that 
I wish we were treated the same way, because RT and Sputnik, as 
far as I know, have no limitations on their ability to access 
the American audience. Any American can watch RT on satellite 
or cable. Sputnik has concluded radio agreements with radio 
stations in the United States. RFE/RL, Voice of America, other 
U.S.-funded outlets lost all access to those platforms years 
ago, earlier in the Putin tenure, which is why we have turned 
to online to reach audiences, and we have been incredibly 
successful, nearly doubling our audience in Russia over the 
last 5 years.
    It is now that online audience that the authorities are 
trying to target with the foreign agent labeling requirements 
they tried to impose on us, which we have refused to comply 
with. So although the Kremlin propaganda says that they are 
just doing to RFE/RL what the Department of Justice does to RT 
and Sputnik, that is fundamentally untrue and not the case.",Testimony on Media Restrictions in Belarus and Russian Propaganda Tactics,"This testimony discusses the severe media restrictions imposed by the Lukashenka regime in Belarus, targeting independent journalists and press organizations. It highlights efforts by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) to counter Russian disinformation and provide alternative narratives in Belarus and neighboring regions. The testimony emphasizes the critical role of independent media in countering authoritarian control of information and calls for sustained support from Congress to protect editorial independence and combat propaganda in the region. Additionally, it addresses concerns about the criminalization of journalism and efforts to control the information space by authoritarian regimes like those in Russia and Belarus."

 \1\ The prepared statement of Senator Johnson appears in the 
Appendix on page 43.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Unfortunately, he has found out, over the last few weeks, 
that not only is it a thankless task, but he has already been 
subjected to character assassinations, as Democrats have put 
him in the crosshairs of another hyperbolic false narrative, 
perpetrated to gain political advantage.
    I hope we can stick to the facts in this hearing today. One 
fact that needs to be highlighted, one part of the false 
narrative, is that the Postmaster General is not appointed by 
President Trump. The bipartisan postal Board of Governors 
engaged a professional search firm that identified Louis DeJoy 
as an outstanding candidate with the necessary background and 
skill set to tackle the enormous challenges facing the postal 
system. The bipartisan Governors then unanimously--again, let 
me repeat that--they unanimously approved his appointment as 
Postmaster General. Mr. DeJoy reports to the Board, not the 
President.
    Another false narrative is that a failure to provide 
funding to the Postal Service will undermine the election. The 
Postal Service currently has $15.1 billion in cash on hand, 
following a better-than-expected financial performance during 
the pandemic. Due to a surge in package delivery, rather than 
being down, the Postal Service's revenue is actually $1.5 
billion higher this year than during the same period last year.


Postmaster DeJoy's commendable attempt to reduce those 
excess costs are now being cynically used to create this false 
political narrative. According to Democrats, the Postmaster is 
trying to sabotage the postal system to disenfranchise voters 
in the upcoming election. Notices that were sent before he was 
sworn in, meant to inform election officials to factor in 
normal postal capabilities in setting their ballot deadlines, 
are being used as evidence of this conspiracy theory, and a 
willing media is once again happily playing along.


 Chairman Johnson. Well thank you for that opening 
statement, Mr. Postmaster General. I just want to kind of go 
through and give you a chance to respond to some of these false 
narratives.
    First of all, let's talk about that election notice that 
was sent out by, I believe, the Postal Service's general 
counsel, one notice before you became Postmaster General, one 
notice, I think, after you assumed your duties. Talk about what 
that notice was about, and, from my standpoint, how important 
it was that the Postal Service does inform election officials 
of what your basic capabilities are so they can factor that 
into their deadlines.


OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PORTMAN

    Senator Portman. Thank you, Chairman, and thank you and to 
Senator Peters for holding the hearing. It is very important. 
It is timely. Obviously, all of us want to see our Postal 
Service work and work well. And let me just give a shout-out to 
David Janus, who is our letter carrier, and to all the letter 
carriers and all the postal workers, because I do think, 
particularly during this pandemic, they are more appreciated 
than ever. And so the men and women who you lead, Mr. DeJoy, 
please pass along to them our thanks.
    I like having this hearing now, because I think there has 
been a lot of misinformation out there, and I like getting to 
the facts. One of the facts I have learned this morning is that 
you started 67 days ago. And much of what we have been talking 
about, in the media at least, including the blue boxes and 
sorting machines, that happened before you got there and it was 
part of a plan. I knew the former Postmaster General. He came 
up through the ranks. He was not a political person at all. 
Anyway, that is helpful to know, that that is what is going on.


 OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HAWLEY

    Senator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. 
DeJoy, for being here. Let me see if I can ask a few questions 
to get started that will maybe help clear out some of this 
misinformation that we have heard repeated over and over and 
over again in the media, and some of it echoed today.
    Just to be clear, will USPS have enough cash on hand to 
support operating expenses through the November election?
    Mr. DeJoy. Yes, sir.


 As I stated, there is no doubt there have been some unusual 
delays--COVID, some of these operational changes--but as I 
check with our constituent service folks, what they are also 
finding is the high volume of calls concerning postal 
complaints. The vast majority seem very highly scripted, like 
this could be a very well-organized effort, which does not 
surprise me in the slightest.
    There are fundraising emails from Senate candidates and the 
Democratic Senatorial Committee dating back as far as April, 
complaining about these postal issues. So I have no doubt the 
Democrats are ginning these issues and these problems up into 
something that it is not, a very false narrative, as I said, 
designed to extract a political advantage.


  I am looking forward to a totally transparent process here. 
I am looking to separate the fact from the fiction, and my 
problem is there is a lot of fiction, a lot of false narrative 
being ginned up by Democrats and the left right now.",Dispelling Misinformation: Postmaster General Addresses False Narratives,"The document presents excerpts from a hearing where Postmaster General DeJoy responds to false narratives surrounding the Postal Service. DeJoy clarifies that he was unanimously appointed by a bipartisan postal Board of Governors and reports to the Board, not the President. He refutes claims of sabotage, highlighting the Postal Service's financial stability and the necessity of informing election officials about postal capabilities. Senators also challenge misinformation, emphasizing the importance of factual transparency amidst political agendas. The discussion aims to separate fact from fiction and address concerns regarding postal operations."

 Through the programs I have described and others, we seek 
to build resilience, increase constructive options and 
opportunities for individuals, especially youth, resolve 
conflict through tailored mediation and reconciliation 
programs, and promote peace and stability-affirming messages to 
counter-extremist propaganda.


 More broadly, USAID's Voices for Peace program, active in five 
countries across the region, uses radio broadcasts to strengthen social 
cohesion by countering misinformation and amplifying moderate voices of 
leadership?. The broadcasts are tailored to the local needs and 
dynamics of each community?. They promote shared values.
               preventing the spread of violent extremism
    As I have indicated, much of the work we do in the Sahel aims to 
address drivers of stress and tension by accurately diagnosing the 
specific nature of conflict. The reality is that violent extremism 
already has a presence and is looking to expand its influence and 
power, as well as spread its toxic ideologies. An important part of our 
work is trying to counter efforts by these groups to recruit more 
individuals and groups to their cause. We work with governments to 
enhance their countering violent extremism (CVE) response strategies, 
strengthen overall response to citizen needs, and promote messaging 
that counters extremist propaganda and misinformation.


 In summary, members of the Committee, we believe the Sahel is a 
region that requires flexible programs that address localized conflicts 
and stresses, and recognizes people often self-identify in terms that 
cross borders and ignore modern government institutions. We seek to 
build resilience, increase constructive options and opportunities for 
individuals (especially youth), resolve conflict through tailored 
mediation and reconciliation programs, and promote peace-and-stability 
affirming messages to counter extremist propaganda. We would welcome 
the opportunity to expand our work. We pledge to continue to work 
closely with the Departments of State and Defense on a coordinated, 
whole-of-government approach in the region. We welcome your input, 
counsel, and appreciate your ongoing support.


Question 5. Russia and China have dramatically increased their 
commercial, diplomatic, and propaganda activities in Africa. Notably 
Russia has reportedly attempted to interfere in the democratic 
processes of countries on the continent. What is the Department of 
State doing to counter these Chinese and Russian efforts?
    Answer. The Department is committed to countering China, Russia, 
their proxies, or other actors undermine global norms and standards. 
The administration's Prosper Africa initiative, aimed at increasing 
two-way trade and investment between the United States and Africa, 
responds to the governance and transparency challenges resulting from 
exploitative economic policies employed by China and Russia. The 
Department is countering threats to electoral integrity throughout the 
continent, including supporting capacity building for civil society. 
The Department is countering foreign propaganda and disinformation 
campaigns in many ways, including by building journalists' capacity to 
ensure accurate and responsible coverage of elections.


",USAID and State Department Initiatives in Countering Extremism and Foreign Influence in Africa,"USAID and the Department of State are implementing various programs to counter extremism and foreign influence in Africa, particularly in the Sahel region. Through initiatives like Voices for Peace, they promote social cohesion, counter extremist propaganda, and strengthen resilience in communities. By addressing drivers of tension and conflict, such as poverty and lack of opportunity, they aim to prevent the spread of violent extremism. Additionally, the administration's Prosper Africa initiative responds to the economic challenges posed by China and Russia's exploitative policies in Africa. The State Department is also working to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation campaigns, support civil society, and build journalists' capacity to ensure accurate coverage of elections. These efforts reflect a commitment to a whole-of-government approach and collaboration with partners to promote peace, stability, and democratic governance in the region."

 As the coronavirus spreads, so, too, does misinformation 
and alarm. For many businesses, particularly Asian-owned firms, 
this can be equally damaging. Because of fear, misinformation, 
and xenophobia, many Chinatown restaurants and stores in my 
city of New York were already feeling economic pain before even 
one person in New York tested positive for the virus.
    Merchants in Chinatown have reported sales drops as high as 
80 percent. Many restaurants and retailers in Manhattan's 
Chinatown, Brooklyn's Sunset Park and Queens are already having 
to furlough staff and may have to let employees go.


 Two, economic stimulus package. Please remember and include 
small businesses in any proposal for an economic stimulus 
package. Regardless of how long this crisis lasts, we feel 
strongly that the Federal government should take quick action 
on this front. Financial aid packages have been given to other 
struggling industries, and the hysteria and misinformation from 
many areas surrounded by COVID-19 that continues to plague our 
businesses show no sign of stopping.


 I am sure you have all read the news. Chinatowns and other 
AAPI enclaves across America are experiencing a drastic decline 
in patronage. A recent New York Times article said that 
business is down as much as 70 percent due to the coronavirus 
COVID-19.
    Sadly, most of this is due to misinformation and overblown 
media coverage depicting the virus as an Asian disease. This 
virus has no color. It has no ethnicity. It has no borders. 
COVID-19 is a respiratory virus, but it is fast-mutating into a 
social virus: xenophobia, Sinophobia, and marginalization of 
American citizens.


We need more help like the loan assistance program so that 
our small businesses in our communities can thrive again. The 
loans give us enough runway to adjust to the changes in the 
marketplace, even if it is caused initially by misinformation 
and unwarranted stigma.


 I believe our business, for the record, has fluctuated, has 
been down in some stores, especially those located around these 
ethnic enclaves. So we have a store, I think, in your district, 
around the Lower East Side. I think that one is flat at this 
point. I think the community around us, including a lot of my 
friends, I am sure you have seen some of the New York Times 
articles, including I think my friend Wilson Tang. He runs Nom 
Wah Tea Parlor. I think there is a lot of misinformation where 
they put the face of coronavirus as Chinese restaurants or 
Chinese patrons, and that is leading to this larger scare in 
your districts as you said.
    I have seen that personally also to a lot of our places in 
L.A., in Chinatown as well. Not that we have a space, but we 
were just in Koreatown as I said earlier, and I have never seen 
Koreatown so empty. And I hear a lot from our friends who own 
these establishments, that they have also faced, I would say, 
some form of discrimination and stigma.
    Chairwoman VELAZQUEZ. Thank you.
    Dr. Bouey, you are quoted saying that we often see 
epidemics of rumors, conspiracies, and discrimination coming 
from outbreaks like this. How can we ensure that facts and 
science prevail in global health crises?
    Dr. BOUEY. Thank you.
    So I always say that where is the epidemic of disease, that 
there is always another two epidemics. That is disinformation 
and discrimination.
	 So in order for us to fight all three epidemics, I think 
the facts that in the social media, in the public is very 
important. If we have the facts in the public area, you have an 
efficient risk communication plan, then we can fight the 
disinformation.


 But the outbreak has resulted in more than just economic 
harm. We have also witnessed horrific instances of xenophobia 
and abuse directed towards Asian-Americans for no reason other 
than their appearance. These incidents rely on harmful stigmas 
and stereotypes that threaten to far outlive COVID-19 and have 
even been repeated by members of Congress. And in the last 
Small Business hearing, I held up a fake flyer that had the 
actual logos of the WHO and the County of Los Angeles actually 
naming five Asian businesses that people should avoid because 
of a man that they alleged had coronavirus went there.


",Economic Impact and Xenophobia: Asian-American Businesses in the Face of COVID-19,"Asian-American businesses, particularly those in Chinatowns and other Asian enclaves, are facing severe economic downturns due to fear, misinformation, and xenophobia surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Reports indicate sales drops of up to 80%, with many merchants having to furlough staff or lay off employees. The spread of misinformation depicting the virus as an ""Asian disease"" has exacerbated economic woes and led to discrimination and stigma against Asian-Americans. Legislators are calling for inclusion of small businesses in economic stimulus packages and measures to combat misinformation and xenophobia. Dr. Bouey emphasizes the importance of facts and efficient risk communication to combat disinformation. Instances of xenophobia, including fake flyers targeting Asian businesses, highlight the need to address harmful stigmas and stereotypes that threaten to outlast the pandemic."

This Act may be cited as the ``Love America Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Since the founding of the United States, the 
        institutions of the United States of America have set the 
        worldwide standard for promoting democracy, freedom, liberty, 
        and virtue.
            (2) Increasingly, students across the country are being 
        taught misinformation, including that the principles of the 
        founding of the United States were lies from the start, that 
        the core institutions of the United States are fundamentally 
        racist and designed to propagate racism, and that it is 
        acceptable to impute guilt to present-day individuals based on 
        the color of their skin, rather than the content of their 
        character.
            (3) The best antidote to misinformation is the truth, which 
        is reflected in the documents relating to the founding of the 
        United States and other artifacts of the United States, 
        including the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of 
        the United States, and the Pledge of Allegiance.",Love America Act of 2021,"The Love America Act of 2021 aims to address concerns regarding the teaching of misinformation about the United States in educational settings. It emphasizes the foundational principles of democracy, freedom, liberty, and virtue that have set a worldwide standard since the nation's founding. The Act expresses worry over the increasing prevalence of teachings that undermine these principles, portraying them as lies or as institutions fundamentally racist. It asserts that the best way to counter such misinformation is through truth, highlighting documents like the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Pledge of Allegiance as essential artifacts reflecting the values of the United States."

 Well, what should concern us now, in 2021, is that the 
current manifestation of these movements is so insidious, 
because while in the past they existed on the fringes of 
society, they are becoming rapidly part of the cultural 
mainstream. These movements are fueled and fed by 
misinformation and lies that, if not addressed, will only 
continue to exacerbate our underlying social divisions and 
threatening to tear at the delicate fabric of our democratic 
culture.


 While the District of Columbia hosts hundreds of First 
Amendment events per year and respects the rights of all 
Americans to exercise this Constitutional guarantee, even when 
we disagree with those viewpoints, we will not tolerate 
violence in our city and we will call such acts what they are 
in accordance with the law--crimes and terrorism.
    In a similar vein, we also know, and we have experienced 
this here in the District, that our foreign adversaries, Russia 
in particular, are employing decades-old tools of covert action 
to fan the flames of cultural conflict here in the United 
States, and our foreign enemies do this by creating or 
perpetuating false narratives that strike at the heart of 
democracy itself--that our elections are rigged, that our 
system is inherently corrupt and should be overthrown, and that 
radical voices who call for violence or insurrection have 
legitimate views that should be heard.


 I appear today to discuss the January 6 attack leading to the 
insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, which, based upon my experience, was 
an act of domestic terrorism. This attack exposed, in the starkest 
terms, the threat we face from domestic terrorists generally, but also 
from right-wing extremism specifically. At various times throughout our 
history, we have witnessed virulent strains of political ideologies 
running through the American bloodstream. But, time and again, these 
radical, violent movements have been rooted out or minimized by a 
combination of medicines unique to the American experience: The central 
role of democratic institutions, the rule of law, and the unshakeable 
resolve of men and women of goodwill seeking to build a better Nation. 
What should concern us now, in 2021, is that the current manifestation 
of these movements is so insidious because while, in the past, they 
existed on the fringes of society, they are becoming part of the 
cultural mainstream. These movements are fueled and fed by 
misinformation and lies that, if not addressed, will only continue to 
exacerbate underlying social divisions, threatening to tear the 
delicate fabric of our democratic culture.


 First, we must regain the narrative.--A byproduct of 
        radical, violent movements entering the mainstream is that they 
        distort real, meaningful debates. ``Right-wing extremism'' and 
        ``left-wing extremism'' are not mainstream viewpoints. QAnon, 
        Proud Boys, OathKeepers, anarchists, and Antifa do not espouse 
        mainstream perspectives, nor should they be treated and 
        validated as such. While the District of Columbia hosts 
        hundreds of First Amendment events per year and respects the 
        rights of all Americans to exercise this Constitutional 
        guarantee--even when we disagree with those viewpoints--we will 
        not tolerate violence in our city, and we will call such acts 
        what they are in accordance with the law: Crimes or terrorism. 
        In a similar vein, we know that our foreign adversaries--
        Russia, in particular--are employing a decades-old tool of 
        covert action to fan the flames of cultural conflict here in 
        the United States. Our foreign enemies do this by either 
        creating or perpetuating false narratives that strike at the 
        heart of democracy itself: That our elections are rigged; that 
        our system is inherently corrupt and should be overthrown; that 
        radical voices who call for violence or insurrection have 
        legitimate views that should be heard. In regaining the 
        narrative, we need to call these actions what they are: A 
        direct assault on our system of government and to call those 
        who lend credence to these views as succumbing to foreign 
        influence.


 As a side note, the term ``vulnerable individuals'' is 
explained more thoroughly in my written testimony and there is 
a graphic at the end of my testimony which you can refer to 
which outlines these terms. It shows a simplistic framework for 
the different stages of how an individual radicalizes and 
mobilizes to violence. This graphic came out of a RAND study 
that was done for DHS in 2018.
    Second, the underlying causes behind the January 6 attack 
also increased the number of vulnerable individuals. So 
recruitment is easier now for extremist groups than it ever has 
been before. Extremist ideas have been mainstreamed and 
normalized through political speech, conspiracy theories, and 
communications that use humor and memes to mask the danger of 
those ideas present.


 The attacks may also meet other criminal statutory definitions, 
such as seditious conspiracy and treason, but we will leave that to the 
investigators and prosecutors to determine.


 1. The global COVID-19 pandemic increased social isolation and 
other stress factors known to increase radicalization. Last March, 
while at DHS, I asked my team to research how pandemic mitigation 
efforts might exacerbate violent extremism. For decades, the Secret 
Service, the FBI, and academic researchers have examined the 
backgrounds and pre-attack behaviors of mass-attack perpetrators. Some 
of the risk factors of violent extremism they identified are increasing 
Nation-wide: Social isolation, financial stress, job loss, loss of 
loved ones, and significant changes or uncertainty in life. My team 
assessed that some groups would perceive public health measures as 
Government overreach infringing on rights and liberties, which might 
encourage anti-Government extremists. And we had already observed 
foreign actors and domestic violent extremists spreading disinformation 
about the pandemic to foment discord and encourage violence.\8\


The rapid rise, even quasi-mainstreaming, of QAnon 
        conspiracy theories during the pandemic.\10\ While the 
        conspiracies alone are not domestic terrorism--there are 
        individuals who have attempted acts of terrorism in response to 
        their conspiratorial beliefs--including the intentional 
        derailing of a freight train near the hospital ship Mercy in 
        Los Angeles and QAnon supporters that traveled to Philadelphia 
        during the city's ballot counting operations who were arrested 
        with an AR-15 rifle and 160 rounds of ammunition.\11\

 Recruitment is easier for extremist groups now than ever before. 
Dr. Miller-Idriss explains that extremist ideas have been mainstreamed 
and normalized through ``political speech, conspiracy theories, and . . 
. communication styles'' that use ``humor and memes . . . [to make] 
extreme ideas seem less dangerous than they really are.''\18\

    The expanded pool of vulnerable individuals resulted in some 
mobilization to violence on January 6. Extremism experts believe we 
will likely see more. There is a high likelihood of violence in the 
coming months on a range of softer targets associated with their 
perception of the ``Deep State'' including infrastructure, mainstream 
media, law enforcement, ``Big Tech'', and elected officials.
    But beyond the short-term, I believe we will be fighting domestic 
terrorism that has its roots or inspiration points in the events 
leading up to and on January 6 for the next 10-20 years.
    3. We lack a shared understanding and unity of commitment to 
address the threat, and discussions about Domestic Terrorism are being 
manipulated and disinformation is further feeding the grievance cycle--
which could cause more people to radicalize to violence.
    There is a growing overlap between extremism and political 
discourse. Foundations have been laid for years by right-leaning media 
outlets that ``mainstream media'' is misleading, biased, or presents 
``fake news.'' In fact, during the 2016 election cycle and its 
aftermath, right-leaning media were heartened (and amused) that Trump 
would ``fight back'' and ``push against'' the ``mainstream media.'' 
This onslaught created an atmosphere of distrust of the ``mainstream 
media,'' and sent many into seeking news and information within ``echo 
chambers'' that provided feedback that substantiated opinions, but not 
facts.
    To wit, there has also been significant conflation between news 
desks and opinion show formats--where the latter presents ``breaking 
news'' opinion as factual news. Already, certain voices on the right 
side of the political spectrum have used opinion media platforms to 
assert that ``the mainstream media'' have declared anyone who attended 
the rally on January 6 a ``domestic terrorist.'' Next right-leaning 
opinion commentary declared that ``radical liberals'' consider all 74 
million that voted for Trump ``domestic terrorists''.\19\


  As an avid news consumer and commentator on this topic, I have not 
seen an example of a major news organization or ``mainstream media'' 
opinion commentator declaring everyone on the right a domestic 
terrorist. Nor, in reviewing the prominent commentators' assertions, 
have I found right-leaning opinion shows to present actual facts and 
evidence to back-up those arguments. In other words, I believe they 
are, based on financial and marketing decisions, purposefully lying to 
their viewers. But that does not matter in our present moment when 
passions are inflamed, and those who are told they are being 
disenfranchised by the ``radical left,'' trust no one but your ``side'' 
to tell you ``truth.''
    Disinformation and lack of action by the Trump administration also 
created an impression of equivalency between extremist groups that 
identify with the far right-side of the political spectrum and those 
that identify with the far-left. In particular, the former President's 
obsession (fueled by right-leaning media outlets' obsessions) with 
ANTIFA--a descriptor that stands for Anti-Fascist--led to a redirection 
of resources away from open domestic terrorism investigations \20\ and 
led many to believe that they are just as dangerous as Neo-Nazis. The 
statistics do not support this belief.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    While all violence should be treated equally under the law, the 
Government should portion its resources to those threat actors posing 
the gravest threats to our National security. The Government will need 
to repeatedly offer the facts about the number of arrests, attacks, and 
deaths caused by violent White Supremacists and anti-Government 
extremists versus those adhering to a far-left ideology. But as with 
the disinformation challenge noted above, it will be difficult for the 
Government to communicate facts to an audience that is predisposed to 
believing the disinformation.
    I agree with President Obama's assertion that we are facing ``an 
epistemological crisis.'' ``If we do not have the capacity to 
distinguish what is true from what is false, then by definition the 
marketplace of ideas does not work, and by definition our democracy 
does not work,'' he explained.\21\


 I believe as the pandemic ends, hopefully later this year, and 
people begin to return to some form of normal socializing we are likely 
to see both a decrease in vulnerability to radicalization--the comforts 
of our old lives will help ease anxieties, people will spend less time 
on-line indulging in conspiracy theories; but paradoxically, the 
increase in mass gatherings will provide the targets that violent 
extremists are waiting for. Therefore, we must be prepared for these 
attacks.


 DHS, FBI, and State and local law enforcement should recognize that 
they are not necessarily viewed as credible voices by some Americans, 
and as such, they should work with voices viewed as credible to educate 
the public about the intent of extremist groups, the ways they recruit, 
and that breaking the law will lead to prosecution and legal 
consequences. In particular, there appears to be significant 
misinformation about the legality of private militia groups in the 
United States. A concerted campaign to educate on what is and is not 
protected by the 2nd Amendment may reduce their numbers.


The recent National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS) Bulletin \23\ 
issued by DHS makes it easier for State and local governments to access 
overtime funding for security functions, which is helpful in a 
heightened threat environment. Congress could consider providing 
additional funds to assist faith-based and non-profit organizations 
which are often mentioned as potential targets by the White Power 
movement. Such considerations should also factor in that many COVID-19 
and QAnon-related conspiracy theories promote anti-Semetic beliefs and 
often list specific infrastructure targets such as 5G towers.


Federal Law Enforcement activity should appropriately 
demonstrate that any threat or acts of violence is treated the same 
regardless of the ideological motivation. In particular, the Government 
needs to explain their rationale for acting, or not acting, on 
situations often raised by those on the conservative side of the 
political spectrum pertaining to ``far-left violent extremism.'' The 
Government should also publicize data on the actual number of acts of 
violence and arrests associated with the protests last summer to help 
debunk the disinformation spread about ANTIFA-related attacks.


First, leaders at the highest levels who have repeated 
their rhetoric, co-opted their conspiracies, and whether 
intentional or not, given extremists the green light.
    The second is social media. No longer does a person have to 
decamp to a clandestine compound in the woods. Today you can 
find hate 24/7 with just a few clicks on your phone. As we 
know, on-line hate can explode into real-world violence.
    We saw this in 2015 at a Black church in Charleston, South 
Carolina, in 2018 at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 
in 2019 at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas.
    Indeed, White Supremacists are responsible for more murders 
than any other type of domestic extremists, accounting for 
nearly 60 percent of all such crimes in the past decade.
    ADL just released yesterday our annual report on murder and 
extremism. We found that extremist activity skyrocketed in 
2020. Sixteen out of 17 of the deaths were caused by right-wing 
extremists, and there were more than 5,000 incidents of White 
Supremacist propaganda in the country last year, almost double 
the number in 2019.


 The details are in my written testimony and I am happy to 
talk about it in the Q&A, but the highlights include, No. 1, 
passing the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act; No. 2, 
coordinating across all Government agencies--Federal, State, 
and local--with a clear prioritization of the problem; No. 3, 
ensuring that extremists cannot serve in the military, in law 
enforcement, or in elected office; No. 4, holding social media 
companies accountable for their complicity in facilitating 
extremism; No. 5, funding creative efforts to prevent people 
from radicalizing and off-ramping individuals caught up in 
these conspiracies; and No. 6, targeting foreign White 
Supremacist terror groups, because make no mistake, this 
movement is a global threat.


 As ADL has said time and time again, extremists must be taken at 
their word. Anyone who has been paying attention to extremist activity 
across the country, or to the chorus of disinformation and hatred 
rampant across extremist media and some corners of social media, will 
tell you that what happened at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 was in 
some ways the most predictable outbreak of political violence in 
American history.
    For many of the people who were roused to violence that day, their 
actions were the product of years of incitement, spread with stunning 
speed, scope, and impact on social media. A portion of these 
individuals constitute a new breed of extremist, one foundationally 
animated by devotion to now-former President Trump. They are also 
living in an entire ecosphere of disinformation, lies, and conspiracy 
theories, ones fertilized by Alex Jones, QAnon, groups like the Proud 
Boys, Oath Keepers, and Three Percenters, the former President, and 
many others.


 Despite the relatively low number of extremism-related murders in 
2020, extremists were not less active overall in 2020. ADL recorded 16 
right-wing extremist-related terrorist plots or attacks through 
November 2020, an increase from the 13 documented in 2019. We also 
counted more than 5,000 incidents of White Supremacist propaganda 
distribution in the United States in 2020, compared to 2,724 in 2019--
nearly a 100 percent increase.
            ADL's Audit of Anti-Semitic Incidents
    Since 1979, ADL has compiled an annual Audit of Anti-Semitic 
Incidents (the Audit) tracking both criminal and non-criminal acts of 
harassment and intimidation throughout the United States, including 
distribution of hate propaganda, threats, and slurs. The data we have 
compiled from the last 3 years show that anti-Semitism in America is 
increasingly pervasive. Our 2019 Audit, for example, recorded 2,107 
anti-Semitic incidents in the United States,\20\ a 12 percent increase 
from the 1,879 incidents recorded in 2018. There were incidents 
reported in every State except Alaska and Hawaii. The Audit found that 
there were, on average, as many as 6 anti-Semitic incidents in the 
United States for each day of the year--the highest level of anti-
Semitic activity ever recorded by ADL. 2019 also included 5 fatalities 
directly linked to anti-Semitic violence, and another 91 individuals 
were targeted in physical assaults.\21\


 White Supremacist Propaganda
    With hate and extremism in America on the rise, White Supremacist 
extremism in particular poses a grave and underappreciated threat to 
everyone in this country.
    The White Supremacist movement is not as overt about its true 
objectives as it might once have been when racist skinheads dominated 
White Supremacists' ranks in the 1980's and early 1990's. Within the 
White Supremacist community, there is some disagreement about the best 
strategy to pursue. Many now seek to dress in a nondescript manner and 
use coded language. They feel the need to adhere to ``optics''\24\ and 
purposefully obfuscate their views in an effort to infiltrate 
mainstream politics. Others hope to purposefully spark a race war, an 
ideology known as ``accelerationism.''\25\ With one approach involving 
secrecy and coded language, and the other sometimes including seemingly 
random acts of violence, both approaches are alarming in different 
ways.


 In 2020, ADL documented more than 5,000 incidents of White 
Supremacist propaganda distribution, by far the highest number of 
propaganda incidents ADL has ever recorded.\26\

ADL Center on Extremism, February 2021. (https://www.adl.org/murder-
and-extremism-2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Propaganda allows White Supremacists to maximize media and on-line 
attention while limiting the risk of individual exposure, negative 
media coverage, arrests, and public backlash that often accompanies 
more public events. It can include everything from veiled White 
Supremacist language to explicitly racist images and words, often 
features a recruitment element, and frequently targets marginalized 
communities, including Jews, Muslims, Black people, non-White 
immigrants and the LGBTQ+ community. We urge your committee to 
regularly consult ADL's Hate, Extremism, Anti-Semitism, and Terrorism 
(H.E.A.T.) Map,\27\ which provides the public with a jurisdiction-
specific, on-going opportunity to review incident and propaganda data 
from all 50 States and Washington, DC.


 ADL's Efforts to Combat Election-Related Extremism
    In the months leading up to the 2020 Presidential election, we 
increased our efforts to combat election-motivated violent extremism. 
ADL's Center on Extremism, in conjunction with ADL's Center for 
Technology and Society, released a series of news briefs and blog posts 
on topics of concern regarding the role extremists and extremism more 
broadly were playing in regard to our political environment. We worked 
with partners to analyze the chatter and trends we were seeing on-line 
across numerous platforms used by extremists, and broke down 
information geographically to assist local partners and otherwise 
mitigate the impact of on-line extremist propaganda.


 Our work became even more urgent in the immediate aftermath of the 
election, when the country heard then-President Trump make baseless and 
increasingly wild accusations of massive voter fraud grounded in 
conspiracy theories. In light of the tension across the country and the 
amply demonstrated tendency of right-wing extremists to try to 
manipulate such tensions and resort to violence, these charges were not 
just unprecedented--they were an abuse of power and unequivocally 
dangerous, like throwing a match into a stack of kindling that could 
light the country aflame.
    It wasn't long before ``Protect the Vote'' and ``Stop the Steal'' 
pro-Trump rallies began popping up Nation-wide, with particular 
attention being paid to Las Vegas,\28\ Detroit, Philadelphia, Phoenix 
\29\ and Atlanta--all cities in States where results were close, or 
where the Trump campaign was contesting the count. On Facebook, support 
for the ``Stop the Steal'' campaign grew rapidly among some mainstream 
Trump supporters. One ``Stop the Steal'' Facebook group, which included 
posts promoting disinformation and violence, reportedly \30\ gained 
more than 300,000 members within a matter of days before Facebook 
finally shut it down. Extremists across less mainstream social media 
platforms, including Parler, Telegram, and militia forums, also 
continued to promote the false ``Democratic election theft'' 
narrative.\31\ After all major media outlets called the Presidential 
election for President Joe Biden, right-wing extremists reacted to the 
news as expected--with anger, distrust, and nebulous, non-specific 
threats of violence.


Our Center on Extremism prioritized monitoring and reporting on 
election-related extremism, both before and after the election itself. 
We dedicated additional staff and resources to ensure that we would be 
able to continue producing news briefs, blog posts, and expertise on 
this rapidly-evolving situation.
            The Growing Threat of On-line Hate
    The internet is an incredibly powerful tool that, by its nature, 
gives every user a platform and a loudspeaker. However, the internet is 
only a tool, neither good nor bad, and can therefore be used by bad 
actors and for destructive ends. The particularly viral spread of 
misinformation and hate depends upon two things: One a human bias and 
the other a factor related to the dominant tech business model, which 
relies on engagement.
    As much evidence has shown--and as tech companies well know--
inflammatory content such as that which taps into existing grievances 
and beliefs will generate quick engagement. As that content is clicked 
on, liked, hovered over, forwarded, commented on or replied to, tech 
company algorithms almost immediately show it to still more users, 
prompting more and more engagement, and thus more revenue. Among other 
things, at its worst, this turns social media into likely the most 
powerful confirmation bias machine we have ever seen, and also explains 
why some advocates have even labeled this business model ``hate by 
design.''\34\

Media--and What to Do About It,'' May 9, 2018 (https://

 Amplification of Hate and Harassment
    Where people go, hate follows. This past year, we have seen 
communities shift into a virtual-first world and, against the backdrop 
of COVID-19, our institutions have relied on digital spaces to continue 
to function. We have increasingly relied on the internet to facilitate 
work, school, worship, and social activities. So too, however, has the 
digital world facilitated hate, harassment, racism, extremism, and the 
proliferation of conspiracy theories. The Asian, Jewish, Muslim, 
Latinx, immigrant, and LGBTQ+ communities in particular are 
experiencing an onslaught of targeted hate, fueled in large part by 
White Supremacists and other extremists.
    Whether you consider it the catalyst or just a conduit, the fact is 
that social media often amplifies hate. It's frequently a font for 
conspiracy theories, weakening societal tolerance post after post, 
tweet after tweet, like after like. And the hate festering on social 
media inevitably targets the most vulnerable--particularly marginalized 
groups like religious, ethnic, and racial minorities, as well as 
members of the LGBTQ+ community.


 At its core, the Three Percenter concept may be best understood as 
a way to simplify, popularize, and spread the ideology and beliefs of 
the militia movement--a right-wing anti-Government extremist movement 
that arose in 1993-94. Its core belief centers on the idea that the 
Federal Government is collaborating with a shadowy globalist and 
socialist conspiracy (often referred to as the ``New World Order'') in 
order to strip Americans of their rights and freedoms, starting with 
their right to bear arms, so that Americans can be made slaves to the 
New World Order and its agenda. Militia activists view the Federal 
Government as tyrannical and illegitimate; some seek to defend 
Americans from its perceived ravages, while others occasionally plot to 
attack the Government.


 The Oath Keepers are a large but loosely-organized collection of 
right-wing anti-Government extremists who are part of the militia 
movement, which believes that the Federal Government has been co-opted 
by a shadowy conspiracy that is trying to strip American citizens of 
their rights.\46\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \46\ ADL, ``Oath Keepers,'' ADL Blog. (https://www.adl.org/
resources/backgrounders/oath-keepers).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Though the Oath Keepers will accept anyone as members, what 
differentiates them from other anti-Government extremist groups is 
their explicit focus on recruiting current and former military, law 
enforcement, and first responder personnel. Their propaganda reminds 
potential recruits that they swore an oath to defend the Constitution 
``from all enemies, foreign and domestic,'' and asks them to pledge to 
disobey theoretical unconstitutional orders they might get from 
superiors--orders that explicitly or implicitly reference militia-
related conspiracy theories,\47\ such as mass gun confiscation or 
rounding up Americans to put them in concentration camps.\48\ Each 
theory goes back to the idea that the U.S. Government has fallen under 
global governance and will at some point use police and military 
members to enforce the New World Order's plans. The Oath Keepers urge 
military and law enforcement personnel to step up to stop the 
conspirators.


 Members of the Oath Keepers have also been arrested in connection 
with a wide range of criminal activities, including various firearms 
violations, conspiracy to impede Federal workers, possession of 
explosives, and threatening public officials.
            A New Breed of Extremists
    President Trump has provided extremists the gift of a narrative 
that will carry them through at least the next 4 years. Extremists are 
often animated by the angry and paranoid conviction that something 
sacred is being or has been taken away from them, and the former 
President has offered a story about a ``stolen election,'' all thanks 
to the treasonous ``left'' and mainstream media, who are, as the 
narrative goes, suppressing the rights and voices of ``real 
Americans.''
    Many of the people who were roused to violent extremism for the 
first time on January 6 as the result of such incitement. They 
constitute a new breed of extremist, one foundationally animated by 
devotion to President Trump, placing him over party or country. They 
are living in an entire ecosphere of disinformation, lies, and 
conspiracy theories, one fertilized by Alex Jones, QAnon, President 
Trump and his most devoted enablers, and many others.
    Over the coming months and years, as they mingle with established 
extremists--including White Supremacists, anti-Government extremists, 
anti-Semites, and hardcore conspiracy theorists--these individuals 
could coalesce into a distinct and potent extremist movement. 
Alternatively, they could eventually add to the ranks of those other 
hateful causes.
    To be clear, this is not to argue that supporters of President 
Trump's policy agenda are domestic extremists. Indeed, 74 million 
Americans voted for him in the 2020 general election, and their 
interests, perspectives, and concerns should not be thoughtlessly 
dismissed. However, we must also recognize that Donald Trump's 
sustained propagation of falsehoods and acrimony--especially but not 
exclusively regarding the election result--has played an essential part 
in fueling our Nation's crisis of domestic extremist radicalization, 
recruitment, and violence.


 While it is hard to say with certainty what lies ahead, we know 
that White Supremacists and some other extremists, including 
Islamophobes, anti-immigrant extremists and anti-Semites, are also 
driven by manufactured fears around demographic change. Some within the 
movement believe these changes will only accelerate during the Biden 
administration as it enacts more welcoming policies toward immigrants 
and refugees who are people of color. Extremists equate those policies 
to ``White genocide.''
    Militia and other anti-Government groups may also be very active in 
the next few years. The militia movement has historically derived much 
of its energy and vitality from its rage toward the Federal Government. 
However, the movement's support of President Trump over the past few 
years dulled that anger. A Biden administration will allow militias to 
return to their foundational grievances--the belief that a tyrannical 
government in league with a globalist conspiracy is coming to enslave 
them by first taking their guns and then the remainder of their rights.
    Finally, anti-Semitism will likely continue to be a central part of 
the conspiratorial views that fuel right-wing violence. Many of the key 
narratives, especially the conspiracy theories that animated the D.C. 
attackers, are also drivers of anti-Semitism.
            Conspiracy Theories
    No one who stormed the Capitol was radicalized the day before. They 
were animated over time by a conspiracy theory about a stolen election, 
stoked by politicians up to and including President Trump, and a 
fervent commitment to preserving the status quo. One of the most 
prominent conspiracy theories supporting President Trump is QAnon, with 
substantial numbers of adherents coming to ``Stop the Steal'' events 
across the country after the election and establishing a notable 
presence at the Capitol attack.
            QAnon
    QAnon is not a coherent organization or movement. It is instead an 
ill-defined and wide-ranging conspiracy theory that encompasses a host 
of other conspiracy theories. It has spread from the backwaters of the 
internet onto mainstream platforms, where it has built a substantial 
following among supporters of former President Trump. Since the 
inauguration of President Biden, QAnon's adherents have been scrambling 
for purpose and direction.
    At its core, QAnon is a sprawling global conspiracy holding that 
rings of pedophiles control world governments. In the United States, 
QAnon adherents accuse leading Democrats and a supposed ``Deep State,'' 
which includes high-profile celebrities, of being part of a cabal of 
pedophiles who were determined to bring down President Trump. In recent 
months, QAnon has been a primary driver of the false conspiracy theory 
that the election was stolen from President Trump by virtue of massive 
voter fraud. The violent mob action and assault on the U.S. Capitol on 
January 6 grew out of the viral spread of these conspiracy theories. 
Yet for years, there have been warning signs that social media 
platforms such as Twitter were providing a fertile environment for 
increased radicalization and potential violence from conspiracy groups 
like QAnon.\49\

conspiracies-trump/).


 QAnon played a key role in the attack on the U.S. Capitol, with 
QAnon accounts on Twitter and other platforms hailing the violence as 
the first step in a civil war.\50\ Reportedly, QAnon supporters were 
the first rioters to enter the Capitol. One of them, Jake Angeli, a 
far-right conspiracy theorist dubbed the ``QAnon Shaman,'' has been a 
predictable presence at far-right rallies supporting President Trump's 
attempts to discredit the 2020 election.\51\ After several QAnon 
supporters claimed Angeli was a member of antifa, Angeli publicly 
denied the charges and reiterated his support for QAnon.

in 2017, has been connected with a number of violent events,\54\ such

Unequivocally, Americans want the Government to do more to address 
violent domestic extremism. Sixty-five percent want the Government to 
do more to address the rise of far-right extremism. Sixty-six percent 
of Americans believe that the Government should prosecute individuals 
who stormed the Capitol, and 63 percent agree that social media 
companies should ban posts and individuals encouraging or celebrating 
extremism and conspiracy theories.

    Pandemics devastate economies, as COVID-19 has done. Pandemics 
expose and exacerbate existing inequalities in society, including 
throughout the recovery. Their economic, social, psychological, and 
political effects last long after the disease has subsided.
    Historically, pandemics have been accompanied by popular resistance 
to public health measures, threats to political authority, increases in 
violent crime, and the spread of conspiracy theories. These things we 
have also seen here.\5\


 The internet and social media offer access to information and 
unprecedented connectivity. At the same time, they have become highways 
of hate, disinformation, radicalization, and incitement to violence 
while they facilitate mobilization and planning. How does a society 
maintain its commitment to free speech but deny those bent upon its 
destruction from hijacking this powerful communication technology?


 \18\ Timothy McVeigh was charged with ``conspiracy to detonate a 
weapon of mass destruction,'' ``use of a weapon of mass destruction,'' 
``destruction by explosives resulting in death,'' and ``first-degree 
murder'' (specifically, the murder of 8 law enforcement officers during 
the attack).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    What many mean by a new domestic terrorism statute is a domestic 
version of the material-support provision of the Patriot Act, which 
criminalizes providing material support to a designated foreign 
terrorist organization. Prosecutors have interpreted this broadly, and 
the courts have gone along.
    The problem with a domestic version of a material-support provision 
is that it requires designating domestic terrorist groups--and therein 
lies the trouble. There are hundreds of extremist groups on both ends 
of the political spectrum, along with other issue-oriented groups that 
conceivably might be labeled terrorist organizations. And organization 
in the domestic context is a slippery term. Some ``organizations'' are 
definable groups. Others are mindsets.
    Some are large. Others are little more than a website.
    The emotive and propaganda power of the term terrorism will raise 
the political stakes.


 Again, when individuals, including the ex-President, would 
make statements, like after the melee in Charlottesville where 
a woman was murdered, where White Supremacists rampaged through 
the town chanting, ``Jews will not replace us,'' when the 
President, the prior President, said that, ``There are very 
fine people on both sides,'' or, again, when he would retweet 
out the rhetoric coming from White Supremacists and use their 
language, like making claims about globalist conspiracy 
theories or telling the Proud Boys in a debate that they 
should, ``stand back or stand by,'' or even after the melee--
after the attack on the Capitol, suggesting that his supporters 
were, ``very special people,'' and that he loved them, when I 
say that this rhetoric emboldens them, I don't mean that 
rhetorically. I mean it literally.


 I will just make one last point. It isn't just about, 
again, the President of the United States. It could be the 
president of the local PTA. But people in positions of 
authority need to clearly and consistently call out 
disinformation, extremism, and hate. Whether, again, it is 
coming from the President of the United States or a first-term 
Member of Congress, those who obsess about conspiracy theories, 
those who spread anti-Semitism and racism, they don't belong in 
the public conversation with a seat at the table. Period. End 
of story.


 Mr. Greenblatt. So there are different types of right-wing 
extremists, Congresswoman, that you could bunch into White 
supremacists and sort of anti-Government types, but racism and 
anti-Semitism is at the beating heart of these movements. They 
believe there is a conspiracy controlled by Jews to use Black 
people to take over the White race. It is wrong, it is lunatic, 
but that is what we are dealing with, and unfortunately it is 
far too prevalent.


One of the most corrosive things I see out there and that 
we have to contend with is the disinformation/misinformation 
campaigns that are out there and that continue to have this 
terrible corrosive nature.
    Ms. Neumann, I wanted to start with you, asking what tools 
and metrics does the Department of Homeland Security have in 
place for measuring the prevalence of corrosive disinformation/
misinformation in circulation?
    Also, Ms. Neumann, I wanted to ask, in your written 
testimony, you highlight that the starting point for many 
extremists is a vulnerable population who may be frustrated or 
angry and are susceptible to messages of blame and grievance. 
You list countermeasures, including community-based resilience 
and direct counter-messaging.
    What agencies or organizations are in place to implement 
these countermeasures, and what more can we be doing?
    But if you can start with the misinformation/
disinformation.
    Ms. Neumann. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question.
    On the disinformation, at DHS, the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA, largely has taken the 
lead around disinformation, in particular because of election 
security, but I believe they appreciated that there is much to 
disinformation that expands far beyond the elections.
    In particular, we noted, when the pandemic was starting 
back in March, we saw early signs of disinformation and 
misinformation. My former staff actually predicted that we were 
likely to see violence related to that, and, sadly, that became 
true.


 There are also some private industry or private-sector 
efforts. Moonshot CVE comes to mind, where they are looking at, 
when people search for certain terms, if they are offered kind-
of an alternative perspective, does that messaging work? Does 
that move people away from maybe the disinformation that they 
were seeking?
    So there are any number of efforts, including one that I 
feel is fairly promising, a peer-to-peer exchange where college 
students, as part of a class in communications, develop 
campaigns to basically counter disinformation. The winning--
usually it is done in a contest style--the winning campaign 
gets paid for to be used more broadly in their community.
    I think innovation is really important here. 
Disinformation, of course, has been around for decades, but the 
viral nature of it through technology makes the challenge very 
hard.


 Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Thank you so much, Chairman Thompson, 
Ranking Member Katko. I am delighted to be a Member of this 
committee and look forward to working with all of you.
    I just had a question. We have heard from several of the 
witnesses about disinformation and specifically disinformation 
in social media. But I also want to ask Ms. Neumann, with a 
very short answer, if you will, do you feel that there was also 
disinformation among the traditional media?
    Ms. Neumann. From time to time, but the term of 
``disinformation'' means intentional. I think what we were more 
often likely to see in traditional media is the misinformation, 
which is inaccurate information but there is not an 
intentionality behind it. That often happens when things go 
viral and it takes a while to circle back around and discover 
things aren't true. That is a common problem that we have in 
this society today.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Did you see on traditional media with 
police cars burning and being told by traditional media 
reporters and anchors that these were peaceful protests?
    Ms. Neumann. No, I----
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Is that considered disinformation or 
misinformation?
    Ms. Neumann. You know, if we are talking about the protests 
over the summer where there was rioting in certain cities, is 
that what you are referencing?
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Yes, ma'am.
    Ms. Neumann. The way that I--and I consume a lot of 
different media, but the media I personally consumed seemed to 
frame this as we did have some places where there was violence. 
Some of it I would classify as traditional criminal riots, you 
know, criminal actors taking advantage of a moment and/or very 
angry and acting out their anger. It is illegal. It should be 
handled appropriately.
	 We also had a number of right-wing violent extremists use 
protests as a cover for acceleration of violence. That is part 
of their ideology. Boogaloo Bois have been arrested. They were 
very prominent in some of the killings of law enforcement 
officers. We saw on-line chatter any time there was a planned 
protest of right-wing violent extremists using this as an 
opportunity to potentially cause acts of violence.
    I think the data might refer to--the ADL, they might have 
better stats, but some of the data that is now coming out 
demonstrates that the preponderance of actual violence, 
intentional violence, as opposed to looting, was sadly more 
coming out of those right-wing violent extremist organizations 
as opposed to what had been argued, that it was Antifa. We, as 
far as I know, only have one incident of Antifa-related murder.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. So thank you very much for that, 
acknowledging that there is misinformation and disinformation 
both within social media and in traditional media, both in what 
is covered and portrayed.
    Mr. Jenkins, there is a question about the National Guard 
and why it took so long for the National Guard to respond. 
Would it be fair to say that the National Guard is made up of 
individuals who are not stationed at a post or a base, they are 
not stationed collectively together, that they have to be 
called upon to be activated, and that would cause a delay, they 
are not like a police SWAT team where they can immediately 
respond to an incident?
    Mr. Jenkins. That is true, that normally the National Guard 
are at their homes and are summoned to deal with various types 
of emergencies.
    However, as we have seen in the cases during the summer and 
in preparation for other events in Washington, National Guard 
units are mobilized in advance to be on standby. They may not 
be visible, but they are mobilized, they are in the area and 
can readily respond.
    I don't know the reasons for the delay in the response on 
January 6, but the fact that members of the National Guard in 
their normal civilian lives are scattered is not one of the 
reasons. We have seen them mobilize to standby before.
    Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Thank you.
    Throughout this have you heard of disinformation on the 
attacks on January 6? I am just wondering if people have 
investigated or looked at irregularities in voting that could 
have perpetuated disinformation. Have we had that oversight 
investigation yet to your knowledge?


  Yes, this was an intelligence failure. Yes, this was a 
security failure. But even more troubling, this was a societal 
failure. Until we put to rest the lies about the election, the 
conspiracy theories like QAnon, and the racist ideologies that 
drive so many toward hate we will not be safe.


 We do have individuals in this country that are both--we 
certainly have people that are mentally unwell. We also have 
people that are just vulnerable, maybe not definably mentally 
ill but are vulnerable to disinformation, they are vulnerable 
to their grievances being fed.


  Even if in QAnon, it is a lot of asking questions like, 
``Well, suppose,'' or, ``What if?'' You know what? Like that is 
gossip and slander. We need to kind-of go back to the basics of 
we don't tell--we don't bear false witness. If you don't have a 
first-hand account of the conspiracy that you think is true, 
then you probably don't need to be spreading it. I think we 
need to help encourage our citizens to get back to the basics 
of civic society.
    Ms. Barragan. Thank you.
    Mr. Greenblatt.
    Mr. Greenblatt. Congresswoman, thank you for the question.
    I would say dangerous conspiracy theories, from 9/11 
truthers to the Sandy Hook kind of people to QAnon, are all 
part of a piece. They are a danger to our National security, 
and they are a danger to our communities.
    So the QAnon folks demonstrate anti-Semitism. They 
demonstrate racism. They demonstrate demonizing other people, 
suggesting that Democrats are pedophiles or part of some 
conspiracy to kill and eat children. All of it is disgusting.


  Mr. Greenblatt. Congresswoman, if I might. So ADL has 
studied extremists for decades. First of all, I would say there 
is a clear link between White Supremacy and misogyny. So we 
should just point out right up front that White Supremacist 
rhetoric and extremist rhetoric often demeans and denigrates 
women. I would be happy to send you and all the Members of the 
committee our reporting and analysis on this.
    Second, it is also worth letting you know that, like, women 
can be radicalized just like men, and QAnon and conspiracy 
theories, disinformation campaigns, aren't just, if you will, 
the portion of one gender.
    We watched, you know, the ADL has watched all these 
extremists as they converged on the Capitol, and there were 
women and men among the crowd. We know that young woman was 
killed when she tried to literally burst into the Chamber of 
the Speaker.


 Ms. Neumann. Yes. In particular I love that you pulled out 
the militia piece. That is something that we could probably 
make an impact on rather quickly if we could do some sort of 
coordinated public advisory, public communication effort to 
educate people that it is illegal to participate in a private 
militia, that that is not Second Amendment activity. I won't 
get into all of the nuance. There are experts out there, 
especially at Georgetown, that have put together the campaign 
that we would need to be able to educate people in the States.
    But I think there is a ton of misinformation out there, 
people thinking that it is perfectly legal and Constitutional 
for them to join these militia, and once you are in that group 
that it is easier for individuals to potentially follow that 
pathway to something violent.


How has the failure to contain and confront virulent and 
anti-Semitic conspiracy theories like QAnon and accelerationism 
led us not just to the lone wolf attacks in Pittsburgh and 
Poway, but to the insurrection here at the Capitol on January 
6?
    Mr. Greenblatt. Well, thank you for the question, Mr. 
Congressman.
    I think we know that anti-Semitism is literally at the root 
of White Supremacy and that it courses through right-wing 
extremism as an underlying theory of the case. They believe 
that Jewish groups, that Jewish people are somehow controlling, 
manipulating the levers of power, Government, Wall Street, 
Hollywood, the media. I could go on. We need to--law 
enforcement needs to recognize this and to see those symbols, 
like what you mentioned were on display at the Capitol.


 It is not thought police to make sure that our police don't 
subscribe to White Supremacist ideals. It is not thought police 
to make sure that our politicians don't subscribe to conspiracy 
theories and want to overthrow the Government. I draw a 
distinct line between the two.


 So, No. 1, again, anti-Semitism is at the core--is a 
conspiracy theory of sorts and at the core of White Supremacy 
in this country. So it didn't just start on January 6. We saw 
this from Capitol Hill to Charlottesville and before that. You 
have seen it again and again. You know, Ms. Neumann referenced 
``The Turner Diaries.'' If you go back and look at White 
Supremacist literature and philosophy, again, it is rooted in a 
hatred of the Jewish people. Again, it is not right or left; it 
is just right and wrong. There should be no excuse for it in 
any public setting.


So that algorithmic routing that happens to the user, 
unknown, shapes their world view and creates what Eli Pariser 
calls ``filter bubbles.'' They are deeply dangerous when they 
are telling people that, again, you have this conspiracy trying 
to hurt them.


The reason for that is that these algorithms are 
engagement-based, right? In other words, they are designed to 
maximize the time that everybody spends glued to the screen. 
They have figured out that what does that to us is content that 
reinforces our most passionate, intense beliefs, our fears and 
our hates. Isn't that correct?
    Mr. Greenblatt. It is absolutely correct. Their business 
models are based on engagement and clicks. As they used to say 
for local news, if it bleeds, it leads. Right? So, again, if it 
is a conspiracy, it drives clicks.
    It is deep--we see that things don't happen in a vacuum. 
On-line hate and conspiracy theories can metastasize into real-
world violence, and we saw that on January 6.


 Ms. Neumann, I really appreciate you offering that 
clarification. The way in which we are engaging--the delta 
between how we treat international terrorism and, sort-of, the 
statutory grounding to prosecute versus domestic, I think, is a 
really salient issue. As you noted, the arrests in September of 
2 Boogaloo Bois, you know, for conspiring with Hamas. The way 
that the FBI, especially in undercover operations, has to, in 
most cases, default to finding an international connection in 
order to move forward on a prosecution, you know, does suggest 
that we need to be reevaluating or, as Mr. Jenkins said, 
fundamentally rethink some of these dynamics. That is a point I 
want to get back to in a minute.


 QAnon, you know, kind-of made it famous to build your own 
conspiracy, so the thing that you might think QAnon is 5 days 
ago has changed at this point. We certainly see that as it 
pertains to, there was this expectation that January 20 was 
going to be the big moment and everybody was going to get 
rounded up and executed in one big day of judgment and Trump 
was still going to be President. When it didn't happen, some 
recognized, ``Oh, I have been conned'' and moved on, but a 
whole bunch just came up with the next theory: Now it is 
January 31; now it is March 4. They just keep evolving the 
theory.


 Although it remains true that malicious cyber attacks are 
an increasing tactic used by America's adversaries to degrade 
our operational capabilities, we cannot ignore the fact that 
physical attacks by extremists in our Nation exist today. 
Physical threats and attacks by extremist groups are one of the 
greatest risks to our democracy, as evidenced by the events 
that occurred against the United States Capitol on January 6.


 I have a question about social media sites. We all know 
that social media sites have been amplifiers of disinformation, 
and we know that social media sites have been an enabler of 
coordination among White Supremacist extremists who might 
otherwise operate as lone wolves but who can organize more 
easily on-line.
    So social media companies have been part of the problem. My 
question is, how do we get those companies to be part of the 
solution? How do we get those companies to do their part in 
countering terrorism?
    Mr. Greenblatt. Who was that question directed to, Mr.----
    Mr. Torres. It could be anyone, but I think it was 
Greenblatt who actually brought up social media companies 
earlier, so I will direct it to you.
    Mr. Greenblatt. Sure.
    So, first of all, I would say your earlier point about the 
global threat of White Supremacy is real. There were European 
White Supremacists marching in Charlottesville. There have been 
American White Supremacists who have participated in marches 
and training exercises in Europe. We saw what happened in 
Christchurch; that harkened back to what happened in 
Charleston. You are absolutely right; it is a global terror 
threat and needs to be treated as such.
    With respect to social media companies, look, ADL literally 
opened a center in Silicon Valley in 2017. I have staffed that 
not with nonprofit veterans but, rather, with industry veterans 
from the technology space. Because we need to have engineers on 
our side working to address these issues. We can't wait for the 
companies to do so.


 We saw what happened in the wake of Capitol Hill attack. We 
saw how they could immediately move, when push came to shove, 
to remove armed militia groups, to remove White Supremacists, 
to shut down those accounts that were spouting disinformation, 
delegitimizing the election, and literally inciting violence. 
They have had the capabilities.


 These racist narratives and beliefs have been reinvigorated thanks 
to one of the most enduring and pernicious legacies of the Trump era: 
the far right's success constructing a false alternative reality, 
bolstered by a never-ending stream of baseless conspiracy theories and 
disinformation. This fight over the frame of reality has polarized 
American society further and fundamentally ruptured trust in 
institutions and information. The tech sector, an opportunistic ally in 
the propagation of this fraud, abdicated its responsibility so long ago 
that it has not been able to meaningfully recover. Only after Trump 
incited a deadly insurrection and Democrats flipped the Senate did they 
suspend the President's accounts and begin to purge other extremists 
from their platforms. The echo chambers have formed, trust in the 
credibility of reputable media outlets has been disastrously 
diminished, and the polarization of American society has accelerated.


 Fortunately, predictions of violent attempts to disrupt voting 
proved largely unfounded, and the U.S. celebrated historic voter 
turnout. But in the weeks after Biden's victory, Trump and his 
compatriots spread disinformation and conspiracy theories at a 
breathtaking rate, and called on State and Federal elected officials, 
as well as judges, to overturn the will of voters in five States. By 
late November, only 20 percent of Republicans surveyed said they 
believed Joe Biden was the true winner of the election, after he won 
the popular vote in a free and fair election by a margin of more than 7 
million and secured the electoral college by 74 votes.
    While most--but not all--elected officials and judges ignored 
Trump, his followers succeeded in temporarily halting the certification 
of the 2020 election during the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6.
    The election, and the violent backlash from the right, have all 
taken place against the backdrop of a global pandemic which has claimed 
the lives of more than 400,000 Americans in less than a year--
disproportionately people of color, who have to contend with white 
supremacist systems that limit their access to high-quality healthcare 
and other vital resources. And skepticism toward safety measures and 
the vaccine--much of it fueled by rightwing conspiracy networks--
remains high.


 Former President Trump has emboldened extremists and given them and 
their conspiracy theories a place in the political mainstream. But far 
right extremism did not start with Trump, his response to 
Charlottesville, or his call from the debate stage for the Proud Boys 
to ``stand back and stand by.'' Nor will it end now that he has left 
office.
    In fact, for decades, the NRA and the broader gun lobby has enabled 
access to guns by anti-government and white supremacist extremists 
through their advocacy against common-sense gun laws, while 
simultaneously harnessing their fixation on guns and violent response 
to perceived government overreach. In doing so, the gun lobby has 
amplified radicalizing messaging to new and broader audiences. The gun 
lobby's rhetorical, political, and sometimes organizational overlap 
with the extreme right--from the militia movement of the 1990's to the 
Oath Keepers that stormed the Capitol--has yielded dangerous and, at 
times, catastrophic results. The arrest of several insurrectionists on 
weapons charges and the presence of gun rights absolutists at the 
storming of the U.S. Capitol are just the latest example of the toxic 
mix of guns and extremism. In fact, just days before January 6th, NRA 
CEO Wayne LaPierre sent a letter to members warning of ``armed 
government agents storming your house, taking your guns, and hauling 
you off to prison'' and that they must ``STOP GUN CONFISCATION.'' This 
is the type of conspiratorial rhetoric that animates extreme right 
actors.


Thomas Gronek.--Arrested in D.C. with two guns, along with 275 
        rounds of .22 cal ammunition and a drum magazine that holds 110 
        rounds of ammunition. Ahead of the election, Gronek posted 
        conspiratorial content about the ``mass takeover of our 
        country.''


 The constellation of far right groups that rioted in the U.S. 
Capitol includes numerous extremist groups and individuals.--Members of 
the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters, anti-government militia groups 
organized around conspiratorial beliefs of looming civilian 
disarmament, were present at the Capitol on January 6. Stewart Rhodes, 
the founder of the Oath Keepers, was photographed outside the Capitol 
on the 6th. After the November election, Rhodes told conspiracy-peddler 
Alex Jones that his group was ready to attack Washington in defense of 
Trump, saying ``We'll also be on the outside of D.C., armed, prepared 
to go in, if the president calls us up.''


The insurrectionists were organized.--Video of the insurrection, 
and cached posts on social media, indicate that the storming of the 
Capitol was not spontaneous. Indeed, prosecutors have charged three 
individuals who were members of the Oath Keepers and/or the Ohio State 
Regular Militia (Thomas Caldwell, Jessica Watkins and Donovan Crowl) 
with conspiracy to obstruct the Congress' affirmation of the Electoral 
College, among other criminal charges, for their actions at the 
Capitol. Court affidavits filed by the government in the case describe 
the Oath Keepers as a ``paramilitary organization'' who ``believe that 
the Federal Government has been coopted by a shadowy conspiracy that is 
trying to strip American citizens of their rights.'' The same affidavit 
describes how the defendants moved ``in an organized and practiced 
fashion'', with one sending a voice message that ``We have a good 
group. We have about 30-40 of us. We are sticking together and sticking 
to the plan.'' One man was overheard offering words of encouragement 
during the riot saying ``Get it, Jess Do your fucking thing. Everything 
we fucking trained for.'' Recorded messages also revealed an individual 
saying ``You are executing a citizen's arrest. Arrest this assembly, we 
have probable cause for acts of treason, election fraud.'' Evidence 
presented in the case further indicates that the defendants had made 
extensive plans for the day, what one called ``an Oathkeepers Op,'' in 
a message, including gathering supplies, meeting up with other Oath 
Keeper groups, and ``night hunting'' of Antifa.


 Symbols of hate were commonplace throughout the Capitol 
insurrection. Far right iconography, such as signs supporting QAnon (a 
conspiracy that places former President Trump as the heroic savior of 
the republic against a cult of liberal pedophiles), Crusader 
paraphernalia (symbols popular with far-right ethnonationist groups), 
and references to Pepe the Frog (a series of memes popular in racist 
and bigoted spaces on the internet), were present. Imagery captured at 
the riot indicate the presence of the neo-Nazi group NSC 131, and some 
insurrectionists wore anti-semetic clothing with sayings such as ``Camp 
Auschwitz.'' Confederate flags were openly flown at the insurrection, 
with at least one with the pro-gun message ``Come and Take It'' 
emblazoned on it. A noose and gallows was erected outside the Capitol, 
and indeed, certain insurrectionists chanted ``hang Mike Pence.'' 
Photographs captured attendees wearing various forms of firearms-
related paraphernalia, including an NRA hat and a patch from the 
extremist gun group the Virginia Citizen Defense League.
    In sum, the insurrectionists at the Capitol were armed, organized, 
and violent.--Apart from the physical presence of guns, the strong ties 
of several of the insurrectionists to gun extremism is hardly 
surprising--guns are a recruiting and motivating tool for the extreme 
right. Conspiracies about election-rigging and the ``stolen'' election, 
driven by a deep state of shadowy government actors, echoed the same 
imaginary threats the gun lobby has parroted for years to motivate gun 
rights absolutism around the supposed looming confiscation of guns by 
the government.


 BLM Counterprotests.--Armed extreme right appeared at a number of 
Black Lives Matter and racial equality protests after the killing of 
George Floyd, with the overwhelming majority of these counterprotesters 
being white. Their appearance followed conspiratorial rhetoric around 
the threat of left-wing violence pushed by a constant barrage of 
statements and tweets from President Trump and his allies, including an 
allusion to gun violence by Trump, who tweeted, ``When the looting 
starts, the shooting starts.'' The theme of false equivalence had been 
pushed by the NRA for years. After a neo-Nazi murdered a peaceful 
protester at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, then-NRA 
spokesperson Dana Loesch lectured, ``Don't think for 1 second that 
Antifa and Black Lives Matter are somehow more virtuous than the alt-
right. It's all the same stuff.'' The Southern Poverty Law Center 
chronicled at least 55 incidents of militias attending racial equality 
protests between the spring and fall of last year.


 the gun lobby and extreme right politics
    For decades, the gun lobby has sought to capture and wield the 
political fervor of right-wing extremists, spreading radicalizing far 
right conspiracy theories about mass civilian disarmament and looming 
authoritarianism to everyday Americans in a craven attempt to stop the 
reforms that would keep guns out of the hands of those very extremists. 
Guns and gun fanaticism are central organizing principles of this kind 
of extremism in America, including that of the groups and individuals 
that supported the storming of the U.S. Capitol.
    In the early 1990's, the NRA used over-the-top rhetoric to 
denigrate efforts to pass the Brady Bill and the Federal assault 
weapons ban. The organization leveraged the deadly law enforcement 
raids at Ruby Ridge, Idaho in 1992 and Waco, Texas in 1993 to 
villainize Federal law enforcement, repeatedly comparing them to Nazis 
in books and full-page newspaper ads, and suggesting the gun reforms 
were authoritarian measures to target gun owners. At the same time, 
armed extremists--animated by the same conspiracy theories around gun 
laws, Ruby Ridge, and Waco--were coalescing into the nascent anti-
government militia movement. One such extremist, who devoted himself to 
conspiracy theories about mass disarmament, visited the Waco siege, and 
read about Ruby Ridge in an NRA publication, was Timothy McVeigh.
	 In a fundraising letter dated April 13, 1995, LaPierre referred to 
Federal agents as ``jack-booted government thugs,'' saying it was no 
longer ``unthinkable for Federal agents wearing nazi bucket helmets and 
black storm trooper uniforms to attack law-abiding citizens,'' all 
while specifically referencing ``Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge . . . Waco 
and the Branch Davidians.'' Six days later, McVeigh bombed the Alfred 
P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, a target he chose because 
it housed an ATF office, killing 168 people. The NRA falsely denied 
connections to the militia movement in the aftermath, instead blaming 
the ATF for ``creating the climate'' that led to the bombing.
    Those kinds of conspiracy theories form the backbone of the far 
right worldview of grievance and siege, namely the belief that the U.S. 
political system is compromised by a shadowy cabal of enemies enacting 
a grand conspiracy. The combination of a deep skepticism toward 
democratic institutions and paranoia over fictional threats from 
shadowy actors leads some extremists to conclude that there are few, if 
any, legitimate democratic solutions to these threats, and as a result, 
mass violence is inevitable or even justified. For these groups and 
radicalized individuals, guns are essential tools for that tactic of 
violence. Beyond simply purchasing or using guns individually, far 
right extremists, especially those in anti-government circles, organize 
politically to advocate against any limit to gun rights.
    The gun lobby has sought to leverage that political activism to its 
own ends, warning its members that the only thing standing between them 
and a grand authoritarian conspiracy or even their fellow Americans was 
their easy access to any and all firearms. To paint this picture, the 
gun lobby draws on many of the same conspiracy theories that the far 
right depends on, particularly those which hinge on the protection of 
lax gun laws: Either the imagined conspiracy has yet to happen because 
Americans have easy access to firearms, or the conspiracy itself is an 
attempt to disarm Americans (so that the first category of conspiracies 
can be executed).


The insurrectionists at the Capitol, many deceived by lies and 
conspiracy theories, believed that not only was the 2020 election a 
fraud, but it was a fraud in furtherance of installing an 
administration they wrongly view as an oppressive threat. As a result, 
in invading the Capitol, they believed they were exercising the 
nebulous right the NRA claims is granted to them by the Second 
Amendment ``to abolish oppressive government.'' This worldview is 
largely responsible for the resurgence of the anti-government movement, 
particularly the boogaloo movement, in the past year.
    NRA communications to its members continue to ``pour gasoline on 
the fire'' of right-wing extremism. In a recently uncovered fundraising 
letter to members, Wayne LaPierre warns of ``armed government agents 
storming your house, taking your guns, and hauling you off to prison'' 
in language that worryingly echoes his words in the letter the NRA sent 
to members mere days before the Oklahoma City bombing. In the recent 
letter, LaPierre boasts that ``only the NRA has the strength to win 
knock-down brawls on Capitol Hill.'' The letter's accompanying envelope 
read ``NOTICE OF GUN CONFISCATION''--an overt invocation of civilian 
disarmament conspiracy theories. Similarly, even after the events at 
the Capitol, the NRA promoted a branded meme on social media with an 
AR-15 and the phrase ``Come and Take It.'' This was the same phrase and 
symbolism that flew on a Confederate flag during protests of the 
Governor of Michigan last spring and that was flown at the Capitol on 
the 6th.


 Questions From Ranking Member John Katko for Christopher Rodriguez
    Question 1. In your testimony you stated that ``we know that our 
foreign adversaries--Russia, in particular--are employing a decades-old 
tool of covert action to fan the flames of cultural conflict here in 
the United States''. Could you elaborate on the impact of these false 
narratives being perpetuated by foreign adversaries? What effects are 
you seeing from the local government level?
    Answer. It has been well-reported in the media, and confirmed by 
the U.S. intelligence community, that foreign adversaries take a vested 
interest in sowing mis- and disinformation oriented around U.S. issues 
to undermine the efficacy of U.S. Government officials--both policy 
makers and law enforcement. Russia, not unlike other foreign 
governments, identify and work to enflame social tensions in the United 
States by antagonizing radicalized groups on social media and other on-
line forums. The results of these on-line campaigns have the potential 
to influence U.S.-based organizations and individuals who champion 
radical causes and demonstrate those beliefs violently.


Questions From Chairman Bennie G. Thompson for Elizabeth Neumann
    Question 1. On January 27 DHS put out a Terrorism Advisory bulletin 
to warn the public about the on-going domestic terrorism threat that 
manifested itself as an attack on our democracy on January 6. The 
bulletin states that ``some ideologically-motivated violent extremists 
with objections to the exercise of governmental authority and the 
Presidential transition, as well as other perceived grievances fueled 
by false narratives, could continue to mobilize to incite or commit 
violence.'' Were there any warnings the bulletin left unsaid that you 
would pass on the American public? What changes, if any, do you 
recommend to the National Terrorism Advisory System?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.


Questions From Ranking Member John Katko for Jonathan Greenblatt
    Question 1. During the hearing you spoke about the impact of social 
media on the domestic terrorism landscape. What do you see as the ideal 
way to address this issue legislatively? Does this involve section 230 
and/or other possible legislative measures?
    Answer. Social media has had a profound impact on the domestic 
terrorism landscape. Extremists use social media to spread 
disinformation, amplify conspiracy theories, gain political aims, 
recruit followers, and provoke violence. They find ways to engage on 
mainstream social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, as 
well as emerging platforms like Parler, and the Dark Web (e.g., Gab, 
DLive, america.win). Today, there is a profound distrust of Government 
and institutions and the mainstreaming and normalization of these 
beliefs (including virulently antisemitic and racist conspiracy 
theories) is unprecedented--millions of Americans believe in QAnon 
conspiracies and other extremist ideologies. The ability for extremists 
to spread their message as far and wide as possible is because of 
social media and the complicity of the tech companies running 
platforms. This has led to dangerous activity on-line and on the 
ground, including the insurrection at the Capitol. To adequately 
address this legislatively, Congress must consider the many areas that 
impact social media's complicity to domestic terrorism because there is 
no single fix to this multifaceted issue.


Second, Congress must ensure platforms put people over profit. Tech 
company algorithms are designed to optimize for user engagement because 
keeping people on the platform for as long as possible, to see as many 
ads as possible, generates revenue. Government must focus on how 
consumers and advertisers are impacted by a business model that 
optimizes for engagement and consider how algorithmic amplification and 
monopolistic power can fuel hate. They should ensure algorithms are 
ethical and fair, so that groups associated with hate, misinformation, 
or conspiracies are not recommended to users--even if it results in 
less engagement from users.
    Third, interrupting disinformation and finding off-ramps and 
effective mitigation strategies to mitigate recruitment and 
radicalization to extremist violence is a critical issue that requires 
a whole-of-Government and society approach. Many individuals have been 
radicalized on social media to the point of storming the Capitol or 
committing other acts of domestic terrorism. Disinformation has had, 
and continues to have, profound risks for our democracy. It is a threat 
to National security. Government must find civil rights-protecting ways 
to undermine disinformation and provide resources to civil society 
organizations working to counter it, such as by supporting the grant 
program run by the DHS Office for Targeted Violence and Terrorism 
Prevention (TVTP). Congress must investigate the impact of platforms' 
product designs that allow hatemongers and extremists to exploit 
digital social platforms and spread anti-democratic and hate-based 
disinformation.


 The U.S. Government has identified state-linked actors responsible 
for trying to intervene in American elections through the promotion of 
cyber hate to exacerbate American polarization and societal tensions. 
While ADL certainly does not have access to the underlying intelligence 
in these assessments, we are alarmed that this may be the case.
    Domestically, Congress and the Biden-Harris administration must 
prioritize countering the threat posed by any foreign malign influence 
that manifests as on-line hate that impacts Americans. Once on-line 
hate has impacted Americans, the tools to counter it are those that we 
may use whether the hate is fueled by foreign governments or our own 
citizens--a comprehensive approach to expose, prevent, investigate, and 
prosecute that hate, when applicable depending on the context. U.S. 
actions to expose, deter, and punish foreign government perpetrators 
are important, and should be considered, but they are only part of the 
solution. Globally, a U.S. foreign policy approach that proactively 
encourages pluralism and offsetting such hateful narratives are also an 
important part of addressing this challenge. Here at home, we must 
engage on countering on-line hate wherever we see it, including by 
establishing an independent clearinghouse for on-line extremism that 
can serve--independently from the U.S. Government--as a mechanism to 
refer on-line extremism that may indicate criminal behavior to law 
enforcement, therefore stemming the tide of on-line extremism while 
protecting civil liberties.",Addressing the Insidious Threat of Domestic Extremism,"The text discusses the insidious nature of domestic extremism, particularly in the aftermath of the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. It highlights how extremist movements are increasingly infiltrating mainstream culture, fueled by misinformation and lies. The speaker emphasizes the need to regain the narrative by rejecting extremist ideologies and calling out violent actions as crimes or terrorism. Additionally, it points out the role of foreign adversaries in perpetuating false narratives to undermine democracy. The text also addresses the recruitment of vulnerable individuals by extremist groups and acknowledges the potential criminality of the January 6 attack, leaving it to investigators and prosecutors to determine."

 Ms. O'Neil, you said something very interesting, which is 
prioritizing our objectives--my words not yours--in Central 
America. Drugs, drug interdiction, corruption, economic 
development. Another one that hasn't been mentioned, communism. 
Translated Russian, Chinese influence in Central America. Is 
this something that is a major factor right now?
    Before you answer that question, I am thinking to myself, 
it is not communism but rather the influence of other emerging 
powers around the country in our own backyard.
    How does this fit into the equation?
    Ms. O'Neil. Well, thank you.
    You know, there has been--in Latin American there has been 
a--overall there has been significant influence and influx from 
both Russia and from China. Russia has been much more about 
disinformation and we have seen that in several cases, trying 
to disrupt elections or increase polarization in countries 
within the region. China has often been a much more heavy 
commercial hand. But we are seeing an increase in interest in 
the Chinese, in feeding into and controlling, for instance, 
when various countries put in 5G or other types of 
infrastructure systems, telecomms and the like and would have 
control of those.",Concerns Over Russian and Chinese Influence in Central America,"During a discussion, Ms. O'Neil addresses the significant influence of Russia and China in Central America. While Russia focuses on disinformation to disrupt elections and increase polarization, China's influence is primarily commercial, particularly in infrastructure projects like 5G. The conversation highlights the growing concern over these emerging powers' influence in the region and their potential impact on various sectors, including telecommunications."

 USAID has development experience to address these issues 
and prevent outbreaks from becoming epidemics, but we are 
hampered. We are hampered when countries such as the People's 
Republic of China and other malign actors do not disclose 
information transparently or share pathogen samples, and 
instead destroy samples and obfuscate facts, imprison medical 
personnel, and silence journalists. In stark contrast, USAID 
builds capacity and strengthens healthcare systems and 
democratic institutions to enable countries, themselves, to 
respond better to global health crises, and that protects us 
back home. We appreciate your support for retaining the 
independence to make these investments ourselves based on data 
and the best available evidence.


 More often than not, we have the tools to prevent outbreaks from 
becoming epidemics--but we are hampered when countries such as the 
People's Republic of China and other malign actors do not disclose 
information transparently or share pathogen samples, and instead 
destroy samples, obfuscate facts, imprison medical personnel, and 
silence journalists.


 At the same time, we recognize how important democracy and citizen-
responsive governance are in responding to the outbreak, and we are 
investing funds accordingly. Unfortunately, we are seeing democratic 
backsliding, closing space for civil society, and crackdowns on media 
freedom as the pandemic continues to unfold. To counter this trend, 
through ongoing USAID programming and supplemental funding, we are 
supporting civil-society organizations and independent media outlets, 
strengthening the rule of law, working with national electoral 
commissions, and combatting disinformation--because we know responsive, 
transparent governments are better-equipped to help their populations 
address the crisis and eventually help to mitigate the pandemic.


 For example, the WHO's Director General must demand 
compliance with IHR obligations. The Director General and the 
WHO's Health Emergency Program must be insulated from malign 
political pressure. Improvements to the process for declaring a 
public health emergency of international concern are overdue, 
and linking travel and trade restrictions together must be 
reexamined so countries can take proactive measures, like the 
U.S. did to protect our citizens, without criticism or 
retaliation.


Mr. Grigsby, I believe the World Health Organization failed 
the American people, failed the world during the coronavirus 
crisis, refused to call out China for its disinformation 
campaign, lack of transparency, the cover-ups. You made 
reference to some of this. From the start, I believe the World 
Health Organization blindly accepted China's leaders' false 
reporting and understated the threat of the disease. They 
repeatedly praised China for transparency and spreading 
accurate and misleading information. January 14th, we know they 
pushed out a false information that there was no evidence, they 
said, of human-to-human transmission of the virus, despite 
clear evidence to the contrary.


 Mr. Richardson. I can start, and then I can pass it on.
    I mean, I just totally agree with your premise of your 
question. I mean, the reality is, China has used this pandemic 
to advance their strategic interests around the world. As I 
mentioned earlier, it does need to be seen in the context of 
their larger efforts. I think we have a lot of work to do, 
especially on the public diplomacy side, to--one, to counter 
misinformation, and our Global Engagement Center does a great 
job of doing that, and also providing----
    Senator Shaheen. Well, let me--I am sorry to interrupt, 
but----
    Mr. Richardson. Of course.
    Senator Shaheen. --let me just ask you, Why do you think 
that is? Why have we been slow? Has it been some of the 
statements that were read, from the President, that suggest 
that we have been slow to recognize what was happening in 
China?


 Question. The Administration provided a shipment of ventilators to 
Russia under emergency authority. Does the Administration remain 
committed to sanctions imposed on Russia in response to its election 
interference and illegal occupation of Crimea and aggression in Donbas? 
Would the State Department be willing to put out a statement towards 
that end?

    Answer. Our actions have sent a clear message to those who take 
part in malign Russian activity: they are on notice. If they continue 
to pursue election interference efforts, aggression in Eastern Ukraine 
and Crimea, human rights abuses or other threatening activity, they 
will suffer consequences. More broadly, the U.S. government has 
sanctioned more than 350 individuals and entities for their involvement 
in Russia's malign activities since January 2017.


 Countries with weak health systems are suffering from a lack of 
laboratory systems, infection prevention and control in health 
facilities, case management, contact tracing, surveillance, and 
behavior change and risk communications. USAID's other global health 
programs across areas such as maternal and child health, nutrition, 
HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, global health security, population and 
reproductive health, and neglected tropical diseases are also seeing 
additional costs and challenges rise from supply chain delays and 
shutdowns, pauses in health services and immunization campaigns, 
inability to reach health facilities to pick up medicines, as well as 
due to misinformation.
    Food insecurity, unemployment, education, and economic shutdowns 
have left many already-vulnerable families even more at-risk. Countries 
with already volatile and conflict-ridden situations are experiencing 
increasing humanitarian challenges. Women, girls, and youth are 
particularly at risk from a rise in gender-based violence, and child 
abuse as a result of economic pressures, stress, and mental health 
challenges resulting from COVID-19.
    Malign actors are using the growing economic, social, and health 
challenges in many countries to spread disinformation and 
misinformation, reverse democratic gains, further violent extremism, 
and increase their influence.


 COVID-19 impacts are being felt across a range of sectors, 
including governance, the economy, civilian security, education, 
energy, tourism, agriculture, and food security, with both short-term 
and long-term repercussions. USAID is working to address urgent COVID-
related conflict prevention and stabilization challenges to preserve 
development gains and prevent backsliding in regions critical to U.S. 
national security. USAID has prioritized support for citizen-responsive 
governance, economic support, and peace and stability. Economic support 
funds from the COVID-19 supplemental funding have gone towards 
combating misinformation and disinformation, reducing the influence of 
malign actors, strengthening economic opportunities, improving 
workforce training and development, and enhancing private sector 
adaptability and productivity so that populations are better equipped 
to respond to the pandemic and not fall into deeper economic and social 
vulnerabilities. Funds have also gone towards improving good 
governance, ensuring the free flow of media and independent journalism, 
countering violent extremism, counter-narcotics efforts, and providing 
social support to the most vulnerable populations. These efforts will 
help improve stability and peace in conflict-ridden regions.


 Since the launch of our COVID working group on April 9 at a large 
NGO virtual roundtable, DRL has hosted more than 50 additional external 
consultations with more than 100 NGOs. Our partners have highlighted 
COVID-19-related disinformation and other malign influence, growing 
authoritarianism, crackdowns on fundamental freedoms, expanded use of 
surveillance tools, and targeting of vulnerable groups, including LGBTI 
persons.


 Question. How is the United States monitoring human rights abuses 
against LGBTQI+ people in the context of COVID-19?

    Answer. The State Department has established a COVID-19 Working 
Group spearheaded by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor 
(DRL) to track foreign governments' autocratic and abusive responses to 
COVID. DRL has hosted more than 50 external consultations with more 
than 100 NGOs and is documenting cases of COVID-19-related 
disinformation and other malign influence, growing authoritarianism, 
crackdowns on fundamental freedoms, expanded use of surveillance tools, 
and targeting of vulnerable groups, to include LGBTI persons. These 
consultations have been instrumental in helping the Department to adapt 
and implement LGBTI programs that are flexible and responsive to the 
impact COVID-19 is having on the human rights of individuals in this 
community.


Question. To what extent do you share these concerns? How might the 
United States play a role in convincing governments to adequately 
address the spread of COVID-19 and be transparent in reporting COVID-19 
cases and deaths?

    Answer. Combating the COVID-19 pandemic will require an 
unprecedented level of global trust, transparency, and accountability, 
particularly in the areas of accurate case and death reporting. With 
the generous support of Congress, through the COVID-19 supplemental 
funding, USAID has been able to promote these best practices in many 
countries around the world. For example, with COVID-19 Supplemental 
funding in many conflict-ridden and vulnerable countries, USAID is 
supporting activities to counter misinformation and disinformation, 
bolster the independent and free flow of media, journalism, and 
information, and support citizen-led governance, civil society, and 
good governance efforts. Additionally, USAID has advanced efforts to 
disseminate in local languages scientific-based risk and behavior 
change materials, and supports surveillance, digital methods of 
tracking cases, points-of-entry screening, case reporting, and contact 
tracing, all of which lead to increased visibility and transparency 
into the accurate numbers of COVID-19 cases. By working with Ministries 
of Health and other local leaders in our partner countries, USAID can 
play a key role in convincing governments and leaders that accurate and 
timely reporting of COVID-19 cases is a strength that will allow for 
quicker assistance, better communication and messaging to their people, 
a reduction in caseload, earlier preparation for infection prevention 
and control in facilities, and most importantly, a reduction in 
livelihoods and lives lost due to the pandemic.


 But, unfortunately, it is mixed with every other threat to 
the United States and they are regional, and it gets a nod that 
there is a threat of a pandemic it frequently takes the form of 
assessing what terrorists would do or malign influences would 
do and do not really focus on what a pandemic might look like.


 The Administration has made three main accusations: that the WHO is 
uniquely close and credulous toward China; that it was late to warn the 
world about the dangers of the virus, particularly its potential for 
human-to-human transmission; and that it opposed President Trump's 
imposition of a travel ban on China. Collectively, the Administration 
has suggested that different behavior from WHO on these fronts would 
have spared the U.S. and the world from the catastrophe that this virus 
has wrought.
    These accusations are false.
    With respect to WHO's supposed closeness to China, it is certainly 
true that WHO is highly deferential toward member states--but this is 
not unique to China. Like any multilateral, member-state based 
organization, WHO is loath to criticize its members in public. This is 
by design; WHO's members (the U.S. included) have traditionally steered 
it to be highly deferential toward member state prerogatives. WHO also 
avoided criticizing shortcomings by the Congolese government, or the 
governments of West Africa, during Ebola outbreaks there; all of those 
members states have far less global power than China.


",USAID's Response to COVID-19 Challenges and Malign Actors,"USAID is actively addressing challenges posed by COVID-19, particularly in weak health systems and vulnerable communities, but faces obstacles from countries like China and other malign actors. These actors hinder transparency, withhold vital information, and spread disinformation, undermining efforts to prevent outbreaks. USAID focuses on strengthening healthcare systems, democratic institutions, and addressing misinformation. It also supports civil society organizations and independent media to counter democratic backsliding and promote transparency. Additionally, USAID advocates for improved global health governance, including demanding compliance with international health regulations and protecting organizations like the WHO from political influence. The organization's efforts aim to mitigate the pandemic's impacts, promote stability, and combat disinformation and authoritarianism."

 Before proceeding with testimony, I would like to remind 
all of our witnesses that you have a legal obligation to 
provide a truthful statement and answers to this subcommittee 
and that any false statement you may make today will subject 
you to prosecution under Section 1001 of Title 18, United 
States Code Annotate.


 Furthermore, the American people want expanded access to 
vote by mail by a 2:1 margin, despite the false reports of 
potential fraud.


 Four, we must educate voters about the election process. 
Voter education is more important now than ever because of 
changes to primary dates and mail voting rules and because 
misinformation and disinformation are real threats that are 
occurring today.


 And we did not talk about one of the big problems that we 
had in 2016 that led to some of the decrease in African 
American voter participation, and that is the problem of 
disinformation and foreign interference. And we know that that 
is still a problem and the big techs have not done enough to 
address that problem, especially Facebook. So we need to create 
massive rapid response systems to combat voter disinformation.
    Another thing that hasn't been mentioned is that of the 214 
million-plus registered voters, some 8.7 percent are on what is 
called inactive lists. If you are on an inactive list in many 
of these States, you do not receive a mail-in ballot. You will 
not receive an application. You have got to go through a 
process to clean up whatever the issue is. And we believe there 
should be aggressive outreach to the 18 million people in our 
country who sit on inactive lists.


 As a number of the witnesses have testified, voter 
registration remains a challenge as does voter purging based on 
false information and poor, to use your language, incompetence 
often that removes people from the rolls unnecessarily.


 Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Ms. Abrams.
    Secretary Benson, President Trump falsely accused you of 
illegally sending millions of mail-in ballots to Michigan 
voters. Can you explain what Michigan actually did, and in your 
mind, is this a partisan issue?
    Ms. Benson. Thank you for the question and the opportunity 
to again restate and clarify exactly what we did in Michigan.
    One, we feel that educating voters about their choices and 
rights in the midst of this pandemic is exactly the job of 
secretaries of state and chief election officers right now. 
What I did in Michigan, as several of my colleagues in West 
Virginia and Iowa and Nebraska and Georgia have also done, is 
simply mail an application to every registered voter for them 
to request to vote by mail and receive a ballot through the 
mail in August, in our August primary and in our November 
election.


  And I also want to mention two things, if I can, because 
there has been a lot of misinformation also about what happens 
when you get an application and why this is so different than 
getting a ballot.
    An application simply enables the voter to both 
affirmatively request that they would like to vote by mail and 
confirm their identity when they do so. It actually enables us 
to clarify and clean our list in a way that ensures that we are 
accurately delivering a vote by mail to our citizens who are 
rightfully registered to vote and addressing issues as they may 
arise if there are voters who may have been recently deceased 
who on our list that we then can learn about and take steps to 
remove.
    So the other piece of this is our effort in Michigan has 
actually enabled us to increase the integrity of the elections, 
to increase the----
    Mr. Cohen. Secretary Benson, let me ask you this. Did any 
Republicans complain about the results of the election and 
claim there was fraud in the absentee votes?
    Ms. Benson. No, not in the May election.


 Chairman Nadler. Thank you. And Secretary Benson, Attorney 
General Barr recently said that he was worried about foreign 
governments sending fake mail-in ballots to manipulate our 
elections. Several State election officials have said this 
concern is baseless, including because States closely track 
ballots when they mail them out in the first place. Does it 
seem plausible to you that a foreign government could mail in 
counterfeit ballots in Michigan?
    Ms. Benson. No, it does not. And to me, that more strikes 
to what is the bigger issue facing our elections and our 
electorate this year, which is the effort to sow seeds of doubt 
in the integrity of the process, and in that way, harm voters' 
confidence in the elections and in their results.
    That effort to push back against misinformation, false 
information about our elections process is one of the most 
important efforts that we all need to be engaged in across 
party lines this year.


 All of this does take resources, but also everyone in this 
hearing today and everyone watching has a platform that they 
can also use to dispel myths and counter efforts to misinform 
the public with facts about the realities, the work we are all 
doing to ensure every voice is heard. And so I think that is 
why these conversations and this work is also important in 
addition to those resources.

",Ensuring Election Integrity Amidst Disinformation,"Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a push for expanded access to vote by mail, with strong public support. However, disinformation campaigns threaten voter confidence. Witnesses stress the importance of voter education and combating misinformation. Secretaries of state clarify mail-in ballot procedures, emphasizing that sending applications, not ballots, is a common practice. They debunk claims of fraud and highlight efforts to increase election integrity. Despite challenges, bipartisan cooperation is urged to protect the democratic process."

The Bureau should also maintain its vigilance in light of 
the risk of disinformation on social media. The Bureau has been 
actively coordinating with social media platform providers and 
plans to roll out education and communication campaigns to 
respond to this risk. We think such activities are essential.
    In summary, the technology innovations that the Bureau 
plans to rely on for the 2020 census create opportunities for 
increasing efficiency and effectiveness of the count. However, 
they also bring with them significant IT and cybersecurity 
risks. Ultimately, the success of operations in the upcoming 
months will be directly tied to how the Bureau continues to 
manage these risks.


 Mr. Dillingham. Sure. First, Congressman Raskin, let me 
thank you and let me thank all the Members of Congress from the 
state of Maryland, and there have been--both with this 
committee and the former chairperson of this committee, I have 
appeared in Baltimore with him and with others. I have been to 
your district. We met with the entire Maryland delegation and 
we very much appreciate your commitment to getting a full 
count.
    Now with regard to--and I understand it was either in the 
press or in the social media, about this Chinese influence. The 
information I received it was absolutely false. We had no 
contract with that entity, and there was no media engagement 
with that foreign-owned entity whatsoever. But we can provide 
you details on that, but I am told that story was absolutely 
false.


 Ms. Porter. Hello. I want to ask you about an example of 
census disinformation that is already spreading, not on social 
media but through the postal mail. Individuals across the 
country, including in Michigan, California, Alabama, and other 
places, have reported receiving a questionnaire in the mail 
titled ``2020 congressional District Census.'' But this 
questionnaire is not from the Census Bureau. It is not the 
census. It is a fundraising mailer from the Republican National 
Committee.


 The census is already facing so many problems with 
disinformation. This fake census from the RNC will only serve 
to increase confusion and distrust, and I call on you to do 
everything you can to actually combat this document. These were 
beginning to be mailed back in early 2019, so this has been an 
issue for over a year now. And we should all, regardless of 
party, avoid politicizing the census. Do you agree?
    Mr. Dillingham. I agree we should not confuse any mailings 
like that with the census, absolutely.


 Ms. Porter. Mr. Dillingham, I have a question about this, 
because I am glad that you have this correct information on 
your page. Do you track census scams over time, and will you 
share that information with this committee as well as with 
other partners and stakeholders so that they know what is being 
circulated that is false, so that when people bring in--what 
system do you have to accurately encourage people to self-
report, and will you share with us what is being self-reported? 
Because I am requesting. I want to know how many Americans 
contacted the Census Bureau to complain about this form. Will 
you provide me with that number, please?
    Mr. Dillingham. We have that information. We will get those 
totals to you.


And I want to respond to Katie Porter's line of 
questioning, and really Mr. Gomez's, on these false documents 
that were sent out by the Republican National Committee. I 
literally passed a bill in 2010, that said that it should be 
illegal to put out information disguised as the Census Bureau, 
and it literally passed. So, it is against the law to do that. 
I need to revisit it and add penalties and enforcement, because 
clearly people are violating that principle.",Addressing Disinformation Surrounding the Census,"In a Congressional hearing, concerns are raised about disinformation surrounding the 2020 census, particularly through social media and mail. The U.S. Census Bureau acknowledges the risks and emphasizes the importance of combating misinformation. Census Bureau Director Dillingham assures that no engagement with foreign-owned entities has occurred and clarifies that false information about Chinese influence was debunked. Congresswoman Porter highlights a fake census mailer from the Republican National Committee (RNC) and urges the Bureau to combat such disinformation. Dillingham commits to addressing the issue and agrees that such politicization undermines the census's integrity. He assures tracking of census scams and promises to share information with the committee. Additionally, Dillingham notes the existence of a law against disseminating false census information, highlighting the need for enhanced penalties and enforcement. This discussion underscores the necessity of accurate census information and efforts to combat misinformation."

 Although the Postmaster General has since paused his 
restructuring plan, he has refused to roll back changes that 
have already been implemented. It is time for the Postmaster 
General to demonstrate to the American people that he is 
committed to the mission and fit for the challenges ahead and 
that the Postal Service will do whatever it takes to get 
election mail delivered on time. We cannot afford to have 
another heck-of-a-job moment.
    More than that, the President must stop peddling 
disinformation that could suppress voter participation and 
undermine confidence in election results. It sets a bad tone.
    Just yesterday, Michigan's secretary of state, who is 
testifying before us today, alerted voters to a racially-
charged robocall using lies to discourage minority voters from 
voting by mail. This must stop. We cannot allow disinformation 
to divide Americans and destroy our democracy.

have the opportunity to do so safely and securely.


 We have already held 5 election security hearings delving 
into issues in our jurisdiction, such as protecting election 
infrastructure through foreign interference and cybersecurity 
threats. But based on today's testimony, we won't be talking 
about actual election security.
    It is clear the only reason we are having this hearing is 
to further the Democrats' crazy postal conspiracy. Despite what 
the Democrats say, the Postmaster General is not conspiring 
with the President to suppress the vote. Actions taken to 
retire sorting machines and reallocate collection boxes were 
put in place long ago before the current Postmaster General 
took over. In fact, under the Obama administration, over 12,000 
collection boxes were removed and more than 80 mail facilities 
were closed.


 How long will it take States to certify results this 
November? How long will Americans wait to know who their 
President will be because of vote-by-mail issues? CISA has 
noted that delayed election results present a prime opportunity 
to spread disinformation and undermine public confidence in the 
election.
    If Democrats truly want to ensure every vote counts and 
protect the integrity of our election process, they should end 
this ridiculous postal conspiracy. They should work with us to 
encourage States to put in place realistic deadlines for mail-
in voting, pass laws to prohibit ballot harvesting, and 
implement procedures to certify election results quickly and 
accurately.

 The coronavirus pandemic, along with what seems to be near-
constant and escalating rhetoric and misinformation about our 
elections, has brought historic pressures on our ability in the 
States to meet this goal. In fact, just yesterday, as was 
mentioned, my office had to correct an unconscionable attempt 
to suppress voting through a robocall targeting voters in the 
city of Detroit that falsely threatened that voting by mail 
would put voters' personal information at risk with creditors, 
law enforcement, and health agencies.


 Again, you know, to us, this is--we are all in this 
together. Democracy is a team sport, and what our data and what 
our experience in Michigan shows, that if we can put 
partisanship aside and just work together to succeed in holding 
elections that are secure, accessible, and on schedule, if we 
fight back against misinformation and speak the truth to our 
voters, it is possible, it is doable to run these elections 
securely and safely in November. Our voters, of course, should 
demand no less from all of us.


Between a global pandemic and what seems near constant and 
escalating rhetoric and misinformation about our elections, 2020 has 
brought historic pressures on our ability to meet this goal. But meet 
this goal we must, and solutions are there to ensure that we do. I am 
here today to talk about those solutions, and to emphasize that your 
partnership--and the partnership of the entire Federal Government--is 
an important part of ensuring that success.


 Claims that vote by mail is rife with fraud are not only 
simply false, they are also an offense to postal workers who 
take our oath of office and our commitment to preserve the 
sanctity of the mail seriously. It is in our DNA to treat the 
mail like it is our own, and handling election mail properly is 
even more of a sacred obligation with postal workers.

 In 2020, those tables will need to be further apart. In 
2020, many of those workers will decline to serve. In 2020, we 
also are not out in the community providing voters with 
information as we would in a normal election year. Instead, we 
are more reliant upon social media platforms and reaching 
voters on-line. This reliance increases the opportunity for 
misinformation to prevail, to spread, to sow chaos, and to cast 
doubt on the very legitimacy of our election.


Five years ago Democracy Fund stepped into the void created when 
Pew left the space. Since 2016 we have funded some of the most 
successful efforts responding to the security threats to our 
elections--some of them recently picked up by the Election Assistance 
Commission (EAC) such as the Center for Internet Security's Non-Voting 
Election Technology Verification program to provide guidance similar to 
the VVSG for the tertiary technology not contemplated in the Help 
America Vote Act (HAVA) and training programs for election officials 
created by the Center for Technology in Civic Life (CTCL) on 
cybersecurity. CTCL recently expanded their training offerings to 
include a module on combating election misinformation and communicating 
trusted election information, an on-going concern for election 
officials. The Belfer Center's Defending Digital Democracy Program has 
offered Tabletop Exercises that have been touted as one of the most 
effective efforts to prepare election officials.


 In 2020 we do not have Supervisors of Elections in Florida out 
registering voters at the local festival, we do not have County 
Auditors in Iowa at the county fair providing voter information, we do 
not have political parties, candidates, third-party organizations in 
front of the library providing voters with information on when and 
where to vote as we would in a normal Presidential election cycle. 
Instead we are more reliant upon social media platforms and reaching 
voters on-line. This reliance increases the opportunity for mis- and 
disinformation to prevail, to spread, to sow chaos, and to cast doubt 
on the legitimacy of our election.


 Continue to provide tools, education, and support for election 
officials.--CISA has proven to be an essential partner to State and 
local election officials by providing election officials with a range 
of tools, education, and support to strengthen the cybersecurity of 
their election systems. Since CISA began working with election 
officials and other partners to increase the security and information 
sharing across election systems and networks, important benchmarks have 
been reached. Notably, CISA has conducted hundreds of vulnerability 
assessments, offered on-line cybersecurity training completed by close 
to 3,000 election officials across the country, and developed tools and 
resources like their Last Mile and Misinformation resources to improve 
election official security posture and awareness. A critical 
contributor to CISA's success has been its ability to build trusted 
relationships with election officials and others in the space working 
to improve election cybersecurity.


To be sure, there were those outside our State who thought 
they knew better how to run our election than we did. Whether 
in Hollywood, New York, or here in Congress, they put out false 
and hateful tweets that riled up citizens of other States to 
jam our phones with obscene calls and even death threats. 
Everything they accused us of and everything they predicted 
would happen was just flat wrong, and they should all be 
ashamed.

Kentucky, and I would urge you to let Kentucky be Kentucky, let 
Michigan be Michigan, and respect the laboratories of democracy that 
lead to innovation in a decentralized election system. Although I'm 
grateful for the CARES Act funding Congress gave us to reduce our 
costs, I would rather you give us no funding at all if it means you're 
going to tell us how to run our elections.


 Chairman Thompson. I thank all the witnesses for their 
testimony.
    I remind the subcommittee that we will have 5 minutes to 
question the panel. I now recognize myself for questions.
    I would remind the Ranking Member from his comments that 
the committee's oversight jurisdiction directs the committee to 
review and study on a continuing basis all Government 
activities [inaudible] of the homeland security. Safe, secure 
elections, free from disinformation campaigns, are integral 
parts to homeland security. Moreover, the United States Postal 
Service is a critical component to the Nation's critical 
infrastructure, and this committee is responsible for ensuring 
the security of that critical infrastructure.
    All of us on this committee are elected officials. We have 
seen elections conducted in our communities time and time again 
[inaudible] by excellent local officials. Clearly, we see 
elections as a local responsibility. We trust those 
individuals. However, President Trump has repeatedly made 
baseless allegations and spread misinformation about voting by 
mail. In fact, in July, the President even issued an appalling 
tweet urging that we delay the American election because of the 
so-called risk of voting by mail. Ironically, we know that the 
President votes by mail, the First Lady votes by mail. The 
Postmaster General testified that he plans to vote by mail, as 
he has done for many years.


 Mr. Adams. I think, all things being equal, voting in 
person is preferable. I will say that we haven't had, that I 
have seen in my reading of history or otherwise, any sort of 
mass conspiracy to steal a State-wide election since about the 
late 1940's, we had a very famous case then. But we still do 
have election fraud, and it tends to be in local races, usually 
a county executive race or a mayor race. You have got a small 
jurisdiction, it takes very few votes to steal it, and you have 
got patronage on the other side of it, and this happens in 
small towns sometimes, mostly the eastern part of our State. 
But those are isolated instance. You see those every once in a 
while. Those are easier to catch if you have got in-person 
voting, because that is the voting where you are supervising 
the voting with election officials.


 Ms. Benson, in 2016, we saw just how easily a hostile 
foreign government can wreak havoc by using social media to 
spread disinformation and sow doubt and cynicism about the 
democratic process, including by trying to make people believe 
their votes won't count. Now, while here we are 4 years later, 
we know that there are still hostile foreign governments doing 
that very same thing. We are unfortunately hearing this similar 
kind of misinformation, disinformation, and outright lies 
directly from the Oval Office, from the President himself.
    You, Secretary Benson, yourself, have been on the receiving 
end of one of President Trump's Twitter attacks against voting 
by mail in which his original tweet was actually false, and he 
withdrew it and then filed another one. But my question is, how 
do you address the issue of dealing with misinformation and 
disinformation to the people that you represent? Specifically, 
how are you able to convince voters that this process is 
legitimate and that their vote is going to count and matter?


Second, we have established a website, Michigan.gov/
election security, which we will keep up-to-date, pushing back 
on every rumor or piece of misinformation that is reported to 
us and proactively also sending out information that gives 
voters confidence that we are on it, that our system is secure, 
and that our decentralized system of elections in Michigan, 
where we have 1,500 local jurisdictions all running elections 
actually helps to eliminate the possibility of any type of 
massive or State-wide effort to impact the security of the 
system.


 Miss Rice. Thank you.
    Secretary Adams, you mentioned something that, you know, 
brought me back to what happened here in New York, my home 
State, on our primary day back in June. Because of the 
pandemic, more people took advantage of voting by mail because 
they did not feel safe going to vote in person. As a result, I 
don't think that New York was prepared, we didn't have the 
appropriate infrastructure in place to be able to get results 
as quickly as possible, right? So there were some races that 
weren't called for, you know, 6 to 8 weeks which, of course, 
feeds into, you know, the President's misinformation and 
disinformation about, well, you know, if we can't call any 
election on election night, then that means whatever result 
comes thereafter is necessarily suspect and fraudulent and 
rigged.


 Ms. Benson. The issue with voter suppression is, as we saw 
evidence. I believe in data and I believe in, you know, 
[inaudible] decisions, as we saw first-hand yesterday, 
[inaudible] remarks that specifically said that, if you vote by 
mail, which is something [inaudible] so they have [inaudible] 
bad things will happen that are [inaudible]. In my view, 
[inaudible] because this is the tip of the iceberg [inaudible] 
for efforts to try to discourage people from voting one way or 
another, or voting at all, with false information, [inaudible] 
scare tactics, that was the case for this particular 
[inaudible].


  Ms. Patrick, there was a discussion earlier about 
disinformation. In your testimony, you identified the 
increasing role of philanthropy in analyzing election data and 
establishing best practices and countering misinformation to 
make sure that honest election information is moving forward. 
As you know, in the Election Security Act, led by Chairman 
Thompson, it would require the President to create a bipartisan 
commission and a National strategy to protect U.S. democratic 
institutions against cyber attacks, influence operations, 
disinformation campaigns.


",Addressing Election Security and Combatting Disinformation,"The debate over election security and combating disinformation intensifies as stakeholders address concerns surrounding voting processes and the spread of false information. While some emphasize the need for in-person voting and express concerns about potential fraud, others argue for the reliability and security of mail-in voting, citing past instances of election fraud being isolated and manageable. Additionally, the role of the United States Postal Service (USPS) in delivering election mail on time is scrutinized, with calls for the Postmaster General to ensure timely delivery and restore public confidence in the postal system. Amidst partisan tensions, there are accusations of conspiracy theories and misinformation campaigns, with some questioning the motives behind election security hearings and initiatives. Furthermore, the issue of foreign interference and cybersecurity threats looms large, with efforts to bolster election infrastructure and counter disinformation gaining momentum. Witnesses stress the importance of collaboration between federal, state, and local entities to safeguard elections from external threats and ensure the integrity of the democratic process. Despite challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and heightened rhetoric surrounding elections, there is a collective commitment to upholding election integrity and combating attempts to undermine public confidence. Through proactive measures, education campaigns, and partnerships, stakeholders aim to protect the sanctity of the electoral system and promote trust in democratic institutions."

  It is evident that prior responses to cyber attack, such as 
naming and shaming, sanctions and indictments, have not 
deterred bad actors from engaging in malicious cyber behavior 
that threatens our National security. I am interested in 
hearing from our witnesses how we can deter this behavior or 
raise the cost of it.
    We must also be mindful that not every cyber attack is a 
sophisticated one carried out by a well-resourced nation-state 
actor. Cyber criminals ranging in sophistication continues to 
wreak havoc on State and local governments and private-sector 
critical infrastructure with less mature cybersecurity 
capabilities.
    Just this week, for example, a hacker breached a water 
treatment facility in Florida and attempted to poison the water 
supply. This follows a year when cyber criminals hacked 
schools, hospitals, and workplaces transitioning to remote 
work. According to McAfee, cyber crime cost the global economy 
$1 trillion in 2020.
    The Federal Government must work to raise the baseline 
cybersecurity posture across Government entities and the 
private sector to reduce avoidable, opportunistic attacks. This 
will free up talent and resources to focus on more 
sophisticated problems. We must also do as President Biden has 
done and treat cybersecurity as a central National security 
priority and not a boutique add-on.

    To be sure, today is just the first of several hearings this 
committee will hold on the cybersecurity threats facing the Nation and 
how the Government and private sector should work together to address 
them.


While general awareness of cyber threats is becoming 
commonplace, the cybersecurity resilience of our great Nation 
leaves undeniable room for improvement. We are still living in 
the wake of the SolarWinds campaign, one of the most 
devastating cyber-espionage campaigns in history, with our 
State and local governments, businesses, and constituents being 
affected by malicious cyber campaigns every single day.
    Think about it: The past year, while we were indicting our 
operatives of the Chinese Ministry of State Security for 
actively trying to compromise COVID vaccine research, Russian 
actors were simultaneously sitting in Federal and non-Federal 
networks, quietly executing what is arguably the most 
sophisticated cyber-espionage campaign in our Nation's history.
    Both of those state-backed campaigns that were taking place 
via a weekly and often daily drumbeat of ransomware campaigns 
crippled city, State, hospital, and school networks already 
heavily impacted by the pandemic.


These cyber threats clearly have real-world consequences, 
and we must do everything we can to help bring these malicious 
actors to justice. The bottom line is that we are still 
struggling against both the highly sophisticated and the 
routine. We can do better, and we must do better.


  Meanwhile, our nation-state cyber adversaries, like China, 
have sophisticated, multi-decade agendas to compromise data and 
leverage it for malicious purposes aimed at eroding America's 
dominance.
    We have a distinguished panel of witnesses who have all 
spent considerable time in the trenches working valiantly to 
keep America safe from cyber threats, and I welcome their 
guidance on how we can strengthen our Nation's cybersecurity 
posture.


Statement of Honorable Andrew R. Garbarino
                           February 10, 2021
    I am honored to have been selected by Ranking Member Katko to serve 
as the Ranking Member of the Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, 
and Innovation (CIPI) Subcommittee. I believe that cyber attacks are 
the most pressing threat to our National security today. Nation-state 
actors are growing more sophisticated and increasingly infiltrating our 
networks and stealing National security secrets, personal data, and 
intellectual property. I am eager to get to work to defend our Nation's 
most critical infrastructure from foreign adversaries like Russia, 
China, Iran, and North Korea.
    As the lead Federal agency tasked with helping stakeholders 
understand and manage risk across all 16 critical infrastructure 
sectors, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) 
plays a key role in ensuring every aspect of our society is resilient 
to cyber threats. As such, CISA must operate as a strong, centralized 
authority to ensure the cyber resilience of all the lifeline services 
that Americans so heavily rely on--including the Nation's electric 
grid, telecommunications systems, health care institutions, and water 
facilities. In fact, just today it was reported that a water utility in 
Florida was the victim of a cyber attack that put the clean water 
supply of 15,000 Americans in jeopardy.\1\ We must do better to ensure 
underfunded and under-resourced utilities in every critical 
infrastructure sector have the security protections in place to provide 
reliable services to Americans.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As my constituents on Long Island and all Americans across the 
country continue to adapt to working and learning remotely as a result 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, I believe it is now more important than ever 
to work with agencies like CISA combat malicious cyber actors from 
targeting COVID-19 relief programs for our struggling small businesses, 
as well nation-state actors such as China targeting pharmaceutical 
institutions involved in vaccine development. We must keep Chinese-
owned technology and telecommunications companies, like Huawei, out of 
our data, infrastructure, and networks across all critical 
infrastructure sectors. I will be tough on all companies influenced by 
the Chinese Communist Party, as well as any other nefarious nation-
state actors.
    The recent SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign launched by a 
sophisticated nation-state actor, likely Russia, is one of the worst 
intrusions of U.S. Government and private-sector networks in our 
Nation's history. We will be dealing with the impacts of this campaign 
for years to come. We must move forward by centralizing Federal network 
authority under CISA, understanding the current risk landscape, and 
holding cyber adversaries accountable. I look forward to continuing to 
address these complex issues with Ranking Member Katko and the CIPI 
subcommittee in the months ahead.
    As we begin the 117th Congress, I strive to improve our Nation's 
cybersecurity posture at every level of government, including 
preventing ransomware attacks at the State and local level. Throughout 
2020, ransomware attacks increased significantly and targeted many 
health care organizations and schools that were already overwhelmed by 
the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, just a few months ago, both the Bay 
Shore and Lindenhurst school districts on Long Island were hit with 
cyber attacks.\2\ I am determined to work with hospitals, schools, and 
small businesses in New York's 2d district and across the country to 
improve their cybersecurity posture in the wake of increasing threats.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I am ready to get to work with the Nation's leading cybersecurity 
experts from both the public and private sectors and I look forward to 
engaging with all these stakeholders in my new role on the 
subcommittee. I look forward to combating this threat as one Nation and 
finding bipartisan and innovative ways to protect our communities 
moving forward.

    Chairman Thompson. Members are also reminded that the 
committee will operate according to the guidelines laid out by 
the Chairman and Ranking Member in our February 3 colloquy 
regarding remote proceedings.
    I welcome our witnesses.
    Mr. Chris Krebs, who is no stranger to this committee, 
served as the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency, commonly referred to as CISA, until November 
2020. Since leaving Government, he has founded the Krebs Stamos 
Group, and he is now serving as Newmark senior cyber fellow at 
the Aspen Institute. SolarWinds is one of Mr. Krebs' clients; 
however, he is testifying today in his personal capacity as a 
former CISA director.
    Ms. Sue Gordon served as the principal deputy director of 
national intelligence at the Office of the Director of National 
Intelligence from August 2017 to August 2019. Ms. Gordon has 
served in the intelligence community for over 3 decades in a 
variety of leadership roles spanning numerous intelligence 
organizations and disciplines.
    Mr. Michael Daniel is the president and CEO of Cyber Threat 
Alliance. Prior to joining CTA in February 2017, Michael served 
from June 2012 to January 2017 as special assistant to 
President Obama and cybersecurity coordinator on the National 
Security Council staff.
    Mr. Dmitri Alperovitch is executive chairman of Silverado 
Policy Accelerator, a nonprofit focusing on advancing solutions 
to critical geopolitical and cybersecurity policy challenges. 
He is cofounder and former chief technology officer of the 
cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, Incorporated.


 The cyber threat landscape is more complicated than ever, 
with foreign governments and criminal gangs alike using 
capabilities that enable everything from run-of-the-mill cyber 
crime, information operations, intellectual property theft, 
destructive attacks, and operations with kinetic effects.
    The bulk of the malicious cyber activity targeting the 
United States emanates from 4 countries: Russia, China, Iran, 
and North Korea. Even in those countries, the difference 
between State action and criminal activity is increasingly 
blurred as contracted or proxy cyber actors support or act on 
behalf of State-directed operations. As long as the tools are 
available, vulnerabilities exist, money and secrets are to be 
had, and a lack of meaningful consequences persist, there will 
be malicious cyber actors.


  the t(hreat) variable
    The cyber threat landscape is more complicated than ever, with 
state and non-state actors investing in and building capabilities that 
enable everything from run-of-the-mill cyber crime, information 
operations, destructive attacks, and operations with kinetic affects. 
Over the last few years, the ``state actor cyber club'' has evolved 
from the traditional big 4 of cyber adversaries--China, Russia, Iran, 
and North Korea--to a more stratified set of actors. The sorting is 
based on capability, with China and Russia at the top of the pyramid, 
and Iran and North Korea, while still capable, a rung below. Non-state 
actors including cyber criminals are also gaining ground.
    Further complicating the ability to paint a clear picture of the 
cyber threat actor landscape is the increasingly blurring line between 
state and non-state actors. For example, contracted or proxy cyber 
actors support or act on behalf of state-directed operations. 
Conversely, state actors sometimes moonlight as cyber criminals after-
hours to earn additional income. And in other cases, non-state cyber 
actors operate with the tacit approval of the home state, if the actors 
do not target their own domestic organizations, in other words ``anyone 
but us.'' New actors enter and leave the playing field daily. Agencies 
reorganize, break up, and consolidate. Criminal gangs are busted, go 
dark, or give up the life of crime. If the tools are available, money 
and secrets are to be had, vulnerabilities exist, and a lack of 
meaningful consequences persist, there will be malicious cyber actors.


NCFs In Practice: Defending the 2020 Election
    The concept of organizing around a key NCF was central to the 
success of the protection of the 2020 election. Led by CISA, the 
election security community across Government and industry came 
together to understand the greatest risks to the administration of the 
election, developed strategies and plans to improve security of the key 
subfunctions and successfully defended the election. We must repeat 
that intensity of effort across the rest of the NCF set. The NCF 
initiative, as shown in the defense of the 2020 elections, has already 
laid the groundwork for the Continuity of the Economy recommendation in 
the 2020 Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC) report, subsequently 
included in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act.
Improving Engagement between Government and Industry
    In addition to improving our understanding of infrastructure, we 
must improve the methods by which we collectively engage on risk 
management efforts. CISA can lead this important endeavor. The agency 
supported the President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory 
Committee (NSTAC) in developing the 2014 Report to the President on 
Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Mobilization.\2\ The 
core concept of the report was to develop a working partnership between 
industry and Government that could be immediately activated in the 
event of a large-scale cyber attack approaching a National emergency, 
yet many of the lessons of the report equally apply to steady-state 
resilience building activities. Two recommendations emerged from the 
report that are even more important than they were just a half decade 
ago.


STATEMENT OF SUSAN M. GORDON, FORMER PRINCIPAL DEPUTY DIRECTOR 
 OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 
                          INTELLIGENCE

    Ms. Gordon. Good afternoon, Chairman Thompson, Ranking 
Member Katko, and distinguished Members of the committee. I am 
absolutely delighted to be here to testify on this issue of 
utmost National security interest. It is great to see you all 
again, even as a private citizen and not as your principal 
deputy director of national intelligence.
    There is little more important work we do as a Nation and 
as a free and open society than that which you are tackling 
here today and in the days to come.
    I am here today to discuss 3 aspects of the issue: The 
nature of the cyber threats we face and that are emerging, the 
domains in which those threats manifest, and the imperatives 
that must drive solutions. My colleagues will discuss the 
specifics of recent attacks and proffer specific next steps. I 
hope to put each of those in context.
    First, in terms of threat, offensive cyber capability is a 
global commodity, the means by which every interest of our 
adversaries and competitors is increasingly achieved. In a 
digitally-connected world, one need not travel great physical 
distance or expend great resource to achieve malign outcome.
    Fifteen years ago, offensive cyber was the tool only of the 
great powers, wielded in a largely unconstrained environment 
with very specific, narrow intention against Governmental 
targets. Today, while it is especially destructive in the hands 
of some, like Russia and China, it is a tool of anyone who 
wants to do harm. While some are more capable than others of 
achieving strategic impact, all are capable.
    In the hands of malign actors, cyber action can have 
physical, political, military, economic, and societal impact, 
as we have just witnessed this past year with ransomware 
attacks, intellectual property theft, theft of PII, 
disinformation campaigns, intelligence collection, and 
disruption of service.
    We need to stop acting like these attacks are special or 
rare or somehow beyond our ken or ability to respond because 
they are happening digitally. This digital activity has 
physical consequence, and the outcomes that cyber actors are 
producing threaten our National security, sometimes in 
isolation, sometimes in aggregate.


  Prepared Statement of Susan M. Gordon
                            10 February 2021
    Good afternoon, Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Katko, and 
distinguished Members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity 
to testify on this issue of National security interest--cybersecurity 
and resilience. It's great to see you again, even as a private citizen 
not your principal deputy director of national intelligence.
    Though my colleagues and I sitting before you all come from 
different backgrounds and have different perspectives on the issue, I 
think we all believe there is little more important work we can do as a 
Nation and as a free and open society than that which you are tackling 
here today and in the coming days.
    I am here to discuss 3 aspects of the issue: The nature of the 
cyber threats we face and that are emerging, the domains in which those 
threat manifest, and the imperatives that must drive solution. My 
colleagues will discuss the specifics of recent attacks and proffer 
specific next steps, I hope to put those in context.
    First, in terms of threat, offensive cyber capability is a global 
commodity--the means by which every interest of our adversaries and 
competitors is increasingly achieved. In a digitally connected world, 
one need not travel great physical distance or expend great resource to 
achieve malign outcome.
    Fifteen years ago, offensive cyber was the tool of the great 
powers, wielded in a largely unconstrained environment, with very 
specific, narrow intention against governmental interests. Today, it is 
the tool of criminals, nation-states, and non-nation-state actors, and 
while some are more capable than others in achieving strategic impact, 
all are capable. In the hands of malign actors, it can have physical, 
political, military, economic, and societal impact, as we have 
witnessed just this past year with ransomware attacks intellectual 
property theft, and theft of PII, disinformation campaigns, 
intelligence collection activity, and disruption of service.


Operational Technology malware.--for many years, the computers that 
run operational processes in manufacturing, power generation, water 
distribution, and other industrial activities were largely proprietary 
and difficult to access from the internet. However, these systems are 
becoming increasingly connected and more standardized. As a result, the 
ability for adversaries to target and disrupt these systems has 
increased. A cyber attack against one these systems would have a much 
higher impact across our digital ecosystem that the typical criminal 
activity.


  long-term goals
    Given these trends and malicious actors, the U.S. Government should 
pursue 3 long-term goals to counter the cyber threats we face. It 
should seek to raise the level of cybersecurity and resilience across 
our digital ecosystem; disrupt adversaries at a faster pace and larger 
scale; and respond more effectively to cyber incidents when they occur.
    Raise the level of cybersecurity across the ecosystem.--Despite a 
growing recognition that cyber threats affect everyone, many 
organizations still have not implemented basic cybersecurity measures, 
such as two-factor authentication, and very few have reached a high 
level of maturity, even those that manage or perform critical National 
functions. They also have not developed sufficient resilience to cyber 
incidents. Given this situation, the Federal Government should aim to 
improve cybersecurity and resilience across the board. Setting such a 
goal does not require the Government to treat all organizations the 
same or not prioritize some functions over others; in fact, achieving 
this goal requires such prioritization. However, given the 
interconnected and interdependent nature of cyber space, the goal 
should be that all organizations reach a level of cybersecurity 
commensurate with their size, industry, and overall function.
    Disrupt adversaries at scale.--Since we cannot rely on defense 
alone, the U.S. Government also needs to increase the pace and scale of 
its disruption efforts, whether against nation-states, criminals, 
hacktivists, or terrorists. Disruption should involve all the elements 
of National power, including diplomatic, economic, law-enforcement, 
cyber-technical, military, and intelligence tools. It will also require 
working with private-sector cybersecurity providers and collaborating 
internationally. While we have made significant progress in these 
activities over the last decade, we need to impose greater costs on our 
adversaries.


 4. Increase resilience.--If we increase our ability to weather 
cyber attacks and maintain operations, then the value to our 
adversaries of conducting attacks decreases. Resilience also enables 
U.S. leaders to worry less about pre-empting foreign threats and 
escalating responses.
   

Cyber threats cross international boundaries quite fluidly. During 
my time at the White House, virtually no issue was exclusively 
domestic. If nothing else, much of the cyber crime that afflicts U.S. 
citizens and businesses has an international connection. On the flip 
side, what we do domestically has implications abroad. Therefore, 
countering the threats we face requires significant international 
collaboration and cooperation.


federal agency cybersecurity
    In December, several private-sector companies identified malicious 
activity that enabled the Federal Government to unravel an incredibly 
broad cyber-enabled espionage campaign. This intrusion effectively gave 
the Russian government unfettered access to numerous unclassified U.S. 
Government networks for over 9 months. It is difficult to overstate the 
intelligence value the Russians gained from this access or the likely 
damage to our National security. That said, based on the publicly-
available information, the activity associated with this intrusion 
appears to consist of espionage, something in which all States engage. 
As a result, although extremely damaging to our National security, this 
intrusion is not an ``attack.''
    The fact that the intrusion does not constitute an attack 
necessarily constrains the U.S. response. ``Constrain'' does not mean 
``prohibit.'' We should respond forcefully to this intrusion through 
diplomatic channels, such as by expelling Russian diplomats or exacting 
a cost in other venues. We should also signal that if the incident 
turns out to involve activities other than espionage, the United States 
reserves the right to escalate accordingly. But we should carefully 
calibrate our response with the knowledge that the United States also 
conducts cyber-enabled espionage.
    Regardless of the U.S. response, the intrusion revealed some on-
going weaknesses in Federal cybersecurity structure, practices, and 
funding. While the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act included 
several provisions that directly address some of these weaknesses (for 
example, authorizing CISA to conduct threat hunting across Federal 
civilian agencies), the Federal Government still needs to aggressively 
reduce its cyber risk. First, it needs to continue consolidating 
cybersecurity services within a smaller number of agencies; just as 
with payroll services, only a small number of agencies should provide 
cybersecurity services to most Federal agencies. Second, Congress needs 
to enable agencies to retire their legacy IT systems at a much faster 
rate. Replacing legacy systems would reduce cyber risk, improve 
productivity, and enhance service delivery. The $9 billion for 
cybersecurity originally proposed in the Biden administration's 
American Rescue Plan would help achieve this goal, especially resources 
allocated to the Technology Modernization Fund.


STATEMENT OF DMITRI ALPEROVITCH, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, SILVERADO 
                       POLICY ACCELERATOR

    Mr. Alperovitch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Katko, distinguished 
Members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to testify 
today.
    I have spanned my 25-year career working in the 
cybersecurity industry, including as co-founder of CrowdStrike, 
now the world's largest cybersecurity firm. Now, as the founder 
of Silverado Policy Accelerator, a new bipartisan public policy 
organization focused on National security, foreign policy, and 
cybersecurity, I am exploring new ways to work with policy 
makers to strengthen our approach to the challenges that 
threaten American prosperity and National security.
    Almost half a decade ago, I coined the phrase that we do 
not have a cyber problem; we have a China, Russia, Iran, and 
North Korea problem. These countries are the 4 primary 
adversaries whose malignant activity we try to counter in cyber 
space on a daily basis, just as we do in the physical world. It 
is also no coincidence that some of the most sophisticated 
cyber criminal groups in the world operate with impunity from 
the safety of these very same countries.
    The latest supply chain attack, sometimes called the 
SolarWinds hack, already the most impactful in our history, has 
drawn attention to serious gaps in the U.S. cyber strategy. 
However, we now know that SolarWinds was only one of the many 
supply chain vectors used by the adversary and perhaps not even 
the largest one. As a result, I, along with other cybersecurity 
professionals, have begun referring to this hack as the 
``Holiday Bear'' operation to indicate how wide-spread this 
activity truly is.
    This event highlights the need for a broader paradigm shift 
in our approach to cyber strategy. Both private and Government 
organizations should adopt what we in the cybersecurity 
industry call an ``assumption of breach'' mindset, where 
defenders actively hunt on their networks for any presence of 
an adversary, believing that they are already there.


 No. 2, Congress should make agencies adopt speed-based 
metrics to measure their response to cyber threats. Under an 
assumption-of-breach approach, the question is not, can we 
prevent an initial compromise? The much better question is, how 
long does it take us to find an adversary on the network and 
eject them?
    In the private sector, I developed what I called the ``1-
10-60 rule'' to measure response times to perceived threats. 
One, detect an intrusion on average within 1 minute, 
investigate it within 10 minutes, and isolate and remediate the 
problem within 1 hour--1-10-60.



 I am grateful for this committee's leadership on cybersecurity 
issues, and I believe that these recommendations would further advance 
America's defense by bringing its cybersecurity strategy in line with 
an assumption of breach approach. As the recent supply chain breach has 
made abundantly clear, we cannot afford to delay these actions any 
longer. Every day we fail to act on them is another day that we leave 
the American government and our people vulnerable to cyber attacks, 
intellectual property theft, and espionage.
    These new steps would also serve to preserve America's 
competitiveness in this new era of competition between the United 
States and its adversaries. This contest has reached an inflection 
point: The nations that present bold, long-term strategies to advance 
their economic, technological, and strategic interests will shape the 
future for decades to come, and the Nations that fail to act will fall 
behind. Modernizing America's cyber strategy is a linchpin that makes 
all other efforts to ensure continued American leadership possible.
    Thank you for inviting me to testify before you here today. 
Silverado is committed to being a long-term partner and resource for 
this committee in our shared missions to address these critical 
challenges facing our Nation.


 Mr. Alperovitch. Yes, absolutely, especially focusing on 
the defense of the networks themselves. I believe that CISA 
should be in charge of defending the civilian government 
networks and Cyber Command should defend the DOD networks.
    Mr. Chairman, I also believe that, as the other speakers 
have said, we need to go on offense. We need to make it harder 
for the adversaries to conduct these operations. Law 
enforcement, in particular, and Cyber Command need to take 
further actions to disrupt infrastructure of threat actors, 
both criminal groups and nation-states, and raise the bar.
    We need to look at using all the tools of our power to 
really focus on the 4 primary nation-states--Russia, China, 
Iran, and North Korea--and what we can do to deter their 
malignant activity in cyber space.


 Ms. Gordon, on the idea of cyber being a tool of 
destructiveness and bad acts.
    Ms. Gordon. Yes. Thank you so much for the question. It is 
a great one.
    I think that our domestic extremists and terrorists got a 
pretty good look at the playbook. No. 1 is, disinformation is 
incredibly powerful, the ability to overwhelm airwaves with any 
sort of messaging. We haven't talked much about disinformation 
as a part of the cyber threat, but it surely is and we learned 
it. They learned a lot of the tool kits that have been reused 
over the past 2 or 3 years. So I think that is No. 1, is how 
can they use their voice.
    Then second is, I think you would expect them to use tools 
to disrupt normal business processes, the normal functioning of 
society, the normal ability of people to carry out functions 
that are much more even in order to be able to shape 
activities.
    I think both of those are well within their ken. There are 
tools available to do it. It will take the kinds of things we 
have talked about from a Governmental level to be able to 
attack those.
    We are going to have to look at how intelligence can 
support that. Because it is a little bit of a slippery slope 
with intelligence on domestic, but I think there is some craft 
that the intelligence community has, particularly born of their 
time in the counterterrorism fight, that can be applied to this 
problem.
    Thank you so much.


 Mr. Alperovitch, we know that foreign actors are 
continuously looking for flaws in our Nation's cybersecurity 
programs with efforts to threaten our data integrity, our 
public health, our safety. China is our biggest global 
competitor, actively engaged in horrible things in their own 
country, stealing our Nation's economic and National security 
secrets, and vacuuming up large swaths of American data for 
nefarious purposes or for their own design. China works 
overtime to get themselves embedded into our information and 
communications technology supply chain.
    Russia had and may still have total access to our 
unclassified Federal networks. It has been reported Iran was 
heavily involved in a misinformation campaign surrounding the 
2020 election.
	 Congress is constantly talking about a deterrent strategy 
regarding cyber campaigns. It is critical that the United 
States imposes real costs on these cyber adversaries to attempt 
to defer future attacks.
    Personally, I think we should strike back in the cyber 
realm. I would like your opinion on that, good sir. In your 
professional opinion, what is the best way to respond to 
foreign cyber attacks?


 Mr. Higgins. OK. Let me ask you to clarify. How would we--
if we are going to respond in the cyber realm, let's say, if we 
identify a cyber actor, we don't know who that sponsor is, how 
can we tell if it is a nation-state? Do you have confidence 
that with our current technologies and cyber infrastructure and 
the American men and women that are in charge of knowing these 
things, do you have confidence that we can tell the difference 
between a criminal actor operating from within a nation-state 
versus a nation-state-sponsored cyber attack? Do you have 
confidence we can tell the difference?


  Mr. Alperovitch. Absolutely, sir. On the first question, I 
do have confidence in the capability of our intelligence 
community. I have worked with them closely over many years, and 
the fact of the matter is, we have better capabilities to 
attribute cyber attack than we have ever had in our Nation's 
history.
	 Over the last 10 years, I can't think of a single major 
consequential cyber attack that was not attributed. Many of 
them have been attributed publicly, and the Justice Department, 
the last 4 years in particular, have indicted all of the 4 
major countries--Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea--for 
their malicious cyber activity.
    But even when we don't attribute things publicly, the U.S. 
intelligence community usually knows very, very rapidly, within 
days if not hours, who is responsible, because of the 
phenomenal capabilities we have on tracking cyber adversaries 
and infiltrating their own networks to understand what they may 
be planning to do.
    So I think we do know who they are very well in most of 
these cases, and I think we can craft the right strategies to 
influence their behavior, including in cyber.


Mr. Payne. Thank you. During the 2020 cycle, we saw a 
significant increase in lies and conspiracy theories during the 
following election. What are the risk of political leaders 
amplifying election misinformation?
    Mr. Krebs. Well, of course any time you have election-
related misinformation, it can undermine the public's 
confidence in the election itself, the democratic process, 
regardless of the source, whether it is domestic or foreign 
interference.
    Again, that was the concept behind Rumor Control in the 
rapid, real-time debunking of some of these themes, like the 
hammer and scorecard machine algorithm that was being 
manipulated by a foreign deceased dictator.
    The point is, we have to get out in front of these rumors, 
this disinformation and misinformation, as quickly as possible 
and inform the American people on how these processes, these 
machines, elections themselves, actually work.
    Mr. Payne. OK, thank you.
    Ms. Gordon, we are still trying to understand the long-term 
damage that Trump's false, incendiary rhetoric around the 
election, coupled with the physical attack he incited at the 
Capitol, will have on the public's faith in our democratic 
processes.
    Ms. Gordon, was there a noticeable spike in chatter to echo 
and amplify ex-President Trump's disinformation narratives?
    Ms. Gordon. Thank you for the question, Congressman Payne. 
So I have been out of the intelligence community since 2019. So 
I am not tracking the information, but let me give you a little 
bit of perspective.
    We know that our adversaries, particularly Russia, but not 
exclusively Russia, have as their strategic imperative to 
undermine democracy, to use any means that they can since the 
Cold War to be able to insinuate themselves into any rift that 
they see to exacerbate that problem.
    So there will be--our adversaries will use that moment to 
do 2 things. No. 1, amplify messages that are destructive. Then 
the second is to take those images and hold them up globally to 
suggest that what we have long said we were is, in fact, not as 
good as what they have.
    So the global impact is also present in addition to their 
using those events to try and further create risk. That is why 
this notion of protecting the digital space has to include 
disinformation, because what we saw was that----
	 Mr. Payne. Yes.
    Ms. Gordon [continuing]. Is as dangerous as anything else. 
Thank you for your question.


Mr. Van Drew. Thank you, Chairman and Ranking Member. I 
think it is good that you put this meeting and discussion 
together.
    Cyber threats pose a great risk to our Nation, whether 
attacks on State and Federal Governments, businesses, or even 
our hospitals. America is the focal point of the attacks. Our 
adversaries are more capable than ever to cause damage to our 
country. This poses a significant threat to our critical 
infrastructure, supply chains, and even elections.
    Every day we face attacks from Russia, China, Iran, and 
North Korea. In our last election, we were victims of cyber 
attacks from some of the world's most dangerous adversaries. 
Just a few days ago, hackers infiltrated a water treatment 
plant in Florida and temporarily increased lye ratios to lethal 
levels.
    In the third quarter of 2020, the world saw a 50 percent 
increase in the average daily number of ransomware attacks 
compared to the first half of the year. That is unacceptable.


 Mr. Clyde. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for having this very 
important hearing.
    You know, we discussed already about the attempt on the 
water supply facility in Florida, and then also in March 2018, 
the Trump administration accused Russia of orchestrating a 
series of cyber attacks that targeted the U.S. power grid.
    My question for Mr. Krebs is, could you estimate how many 
times a day or estimate the scope of how many attempts bad 
actors try when they attempt to breach U.S. critical 
infrastructure networks?
    Mr. Krebs. My dog upstairs is trying to answer the question 
right now. I apologize for that.
    Mr. Clyde. Would you like me to repeat it?
    Mr. Krebs. Would you mind coming back to me?
    Mr. Clyde. Sure, sure, sure, no problem. Could you estimate 
how many times a day a bad actor attempts to breach a U.S. 
critical infrastructure network in our country? Could you give 
us an idea of the scope?
    Mr. Krebs. I will try over the dog's barking. Clearly, 
somebody that is walking dogs on the street.
    It is--when I say try, it is actually really hard to make 
any sort of meaningful quantification. There are both automated 
tools that run on a regular basis looking for vulnerable 
systems connected to the internet, and then there are focused, 
human-powered initiatives or efforts. We are talking--I would 
even, I would hesitate, millions and millions and millions. I 
mean, we are talking just massive numbers of scanning attempts 
on a regular basis. That is just the noise of the internet. The 
more sophisticated, capable efforts are going to be fewer in 
number, going after the bigger fish to catch.


Mr. Krebs, I just want to take the opportunity to thank you 
for doing the right thing during your tenure at CISA and 
refuting Donald Trump's lies and disinformation about the 2020 
election.


 In 2018, the maritime sector saw 2 massive ransomware and 
malware attacks on the maritime industry, impacting the ports 
of Barcelona, Spain, and San Diego, California.
    These attacks seem to be focused and potentially made 
increasingly easier as the convergence of information 
technology, or IT, and operational technology, OT, systems 
become more integrated. According to varying industry reports, 
the number of maritime-focused cyber threats and incidents have 
risen by as much as 900 percent.
    These cyber attacks have great economic impact to maritime 
ports, especially those that are integrated into our 
transportation networks. These attacks can cause reputational 
harm, financial loss, and even physical damage, especially in 
the cases of compromised dockside equipment or vessel.
    The Port of Los Angeles, in my district, has invested to 
create a cybersecurity operation center and has a dedicated 
cybersecurity team whose role is to protect the cyber aspects 
of the port. To create additional centers and resources will 
require investment by Federal, State, local, and private 
industry partners. Without such investments, this will greatly 
cripple and potentially hinder American supply chains and 
response efforts to catastrophic events like the COVID 
pandemic.


 I guess the analogy that I have just been working with and 
I would love to get some reactions on is more of, how do we 
preempt a cyber Chicago fire? You know, after the Chicago fire, 
you had changes in building codes, you had, you know, 
investments in fire departments, everything from the 
installation of sprinkler systems to, later, smoke detectors.
    You know, although a cyber attack is obviously much more 
intentional, you know, we saw with the breach at the Oldsmar 
water facility, you know, that it was an outdated version of 
TeamViewer that was left on the computers--you know, obviously 
an example of just very poor cyber hygiene and a failure to 
have basic defenses.
    You know, how can we change our thinking on the resiliency 
side to not just be focused on the catastrophic but all of the 
ways in which, short of catastrophe, we can incrementally be 
increasing our overall resiliency?
    I don't know, Mr. Krebs, I would love for you to touch upon 
that and just within the idea of CISA as running point within 
all of those nodes.
    Mr. Krebs. So I think this is an interesting question, and 
it is one that I think has probably been asked in hearings like 
this now for going on 10 years-plus, you know, when are we 
going to see the cyber Pearl Harbor. I am not sure we are ever 
going to see it.


Mrs. Demings. Right. I appreciate you saying that, because 
relaxing too soon, we know the consequences of that.
    My last question, and I would like to address it to Mr. 
Daniel: You know, cyber attacks, we all know now, is the new 
weapon of choice, whether it is to rob you blind from your bank 
account or to have a major attack. But it does not seem to me 
that we are really prepared for this new weapon of choice.
    Could you just talk a little bit about, you know, 
historically where we are, where we need to go, and did it just 
kind-of sneak up on us, this new weapon of choice, cyber 
attack?
    Mr. Daniel. Thank you, Representative. That is a very good 
question.
    You know, if you actually look at how the internet 
developed and the way that people thought about the internet, 
Chris is absolutely right; it was supposed to be this new 
utopia. It was supposed to bring all these benefits. We didn't 
really think through how it made us more vulnerable.
    We have seen this over and over again, of how the tools 
that were originally built to do good things also turned out to 
enable the bad guys to do malicious things. I think that it has 
taken us a while to sort-of shed that sort-of initial sort-of 
purely optimistic view of everything about the internet being 
good and start to realize that it can also be used for harm.


 Mrs. Cammack. I appreciate it. Thanks for giving a little 
bit of grace to a freshman. I appreciate that.
    I would like to get some input from our experts here on the 
``Tallinn Manual'' that has really kind-of been the guide 
internationally as we have looked to address and respond to 
cyber attacks, both from lone-wolf-type actors to state-on-
state attacks.


 Mr. Guest. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Since the creation of the internet, we have been battling 
cyber attacks. New cyber attacks, as we know, have been 
highlighted by the recent actions involving SolarWinds. We have 
discussed that in great detail.
    You mentioned that particularly, Mr. Daniel, in your 
report. On page 9 of your written testimony, you say, ``In 
December, several private-sector companies identified malicious 
activity that enabled the Federal Government to unravel an 
incredibly broad cyber-enabled espionage campaign. This 
intrusion effectively gave the Russian Government unfettered 
access to numerous unclassified U.S. Government networks for 
over 9 months. It is difficult to overstate the intelligence 
value the Russians gained from this access or the likely damage 
to our National security.''


 Mr. Guest. Let me change gears with the panel just very 
quickly. What efforts are being made to leverage technical 
expertise that exists in many of our universities across the 
country?
    Both myself and Chairman Thompson have universities, major 
universities, here in Mississippi that are both doing great 
work in the area of cyber research. So my question to the 
entire panel is, how can we incorporate this work being done at 
our academic institutions into our National strategy to combat 
cyber attacks?
    Ms. Gordon. I will start and be brief and so we can see the 
whole perspective. No. 1, I think in many instances, the 
Government does and has relied on the work going in our 
academic universities, particularly in the research that is 
going to allow us to be prepared in the future.


 As Ranking Member for the Subcommittee of Cybersecurity, 
Infrastructure Protection, and Innovation, I am looking forward 
to working with Chairwoman Clarke to implement some of the 
recommendations that we heard today.
    I have just, like, 1 or 2 questions. You know, we heard 
about SolarWind and how it was the largest cyber attack on the 
country up to date. It exposed that we were unprepared, that we 
were underresourced to deal with the attack.
    President Biden has recommended a multibillion-dollar 
infusion for Federal IT modernization and cybersecurity to 
respond to the SolarWinds breach.


 Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
    Question 2. Are there any gaps where you think the Legislative 
branch might step in to protect the United States against cybersecurity 
threats, including misinformation? Moving forward, how can Congress 
help CISA in their efforts?
    Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.

",Strengthening Cybersecurity Resilience: Testimony and Recommendations,"The testimony and recommendations presented by various experts highlight the urgent need to strengthen cybersecurity resilience in the face of escalating cyber threats. Despite previous measures such as naming and shaming, sanctions, and indictments, malicious cyber behavior continues to pose significant risks to national security. The witnesses emphasize the evolving nature of cyber threats, with both state and non-state actors increasingly leveraging sophisticated capabilities to conduct cybercrime, espionage, and disruptive attacks."

 Today the committee is meeting to examine world-wide 
threats to the homeland 20 years after 9/11. It is the 
committee's long-standing practice to meet annually with 
National security leaders to discuss the global threat 
landscape and the U.S. response. This year especially we 
reflect on the incredible transformation of our National 
security apparatus, an expansion of the homeland security 
enterprise over the last two decades. We recognize the success 
we have had in preventing another 9/11-style attack, but are 
sobered by the challenges posed by long-standing and emerging 
homeland security threats.
    Some of these threats include the recent riots and domestic 
terrorism, more frequent cyber attacks from increasingly 
sophisticated actors, and the security implications of the 
Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan.


 We recognize the success we have had in preventing another 9/11-
style attack, but are sobered by the challenges posed by long-standing 
and emerging homeland security threats. Some of these threats include 
the recent rise domestic terrorism; more frequent cyber attacks from 
increasingly sophisticated actors; and the security implications of the 
Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan.


 Last, but most certainly not least, is the rapidly increasing 
challenges facing the homeland from adversarial nation-states 
overseas--namely China. As the Chinese Communist Party aims to 
undermine the United States at every turn, I see aggressive moves on 
Beijing's part to increase its investments in the Western Hemisphere. 
If we are unable to counter China's malign influence in our own 
backyard, I worry to think how successful we will be elsewhere. Threats 
posed by China underpin supply chain security challenges that are 
leading this committee into new economic security oversight efforts.


 In the years immediately following 9/11, we focused on foreign 
terrorists who sought to harm us within our borders and threaten our 
interests and assets abroad. In partnership with Federal agencies 
spanning the law enforcement, counterterrorism, and intelligence 
communities, DHS built a multi-layered screening and vetting 
architecture to prevent certain individuals from traveling to or 
entering our country by air, land, or sea. We also issued a call for 
vigilance on the part of local communities and individuals alike.
    The first major evolution of the terrorist threat emerged in the 
form of the home-grown violent extremist (HVE)--the individual in 
America who is radicalized by a foreign terrorist organization's 
ideology. HVEs became the most prominent terrorism-related threat to 
the homeland. In response, we partnered with law enforcement, first 
responders, social workers, mental health experts, and local 
communities to identify signs of radicalization and prevent violence 
before it occurred.
    That threat has continued to evolve. Today, U.S.-based lone actors 
and small groups, including HVEs and domestic violent extremists (DVEs) 
who are inspired by a broad range of ideological motivations, pose the 
most significant and persistent terrorism-related threat to our 
country. DVEs are motivated by various factors, including racial bias, 
perceived Government overreach, conspiracy theories promoting violence, 
and false narratives about unsubstantiated fraud in the 2020 
Presidential election. Among DVEs, racially or ethnically motivated 
violent extremists, including White supremacists (RMVE-WS), will likely 
remain the most lethal DVE movement in the homeland. Since 2020, 
however, we have also seen a significant increase in anti-Government 
and anti-authority violent extremism, particularly from militia violent 
extremists (MVEs), which typically target law enforcement, elected 
officials, and Government personnel and facilities.


   election security and malign foreign influence
    DHS continues working closely with State, local, Tribal, and 
territorial partners to ensure their election systems are protected 
against interference. The Biden-Harris administration has continually 
called out malign actors, such as the PRC, Russia, and Iran, that seek 
to interfere in our elections and threaten our democratic institutions.
    Since 2016, Russia has continued to amplify mis- and disinformation 
about U.S. candidates for political office and the security of U.S. 
election systems, with the goal of sowing divisiveness and confusion, 
and weakening our democratic institutions. Iran continues to amplify 
narratives about perceived sociopolitical divisions to exacerbate 
domestic tensions. The PRC has consistently pushed conspiracy theories 
about the COVID-19 pandemic, including about its origin. Russia, Iran, 
and PRC, as well as other malign influence actors, also continue to 
disseminate and amplify inaccurate information to international and 
U.S. audiences about topics such as racial justice, false claims about 
the 2020 Presidential election, the efficacy of U.S. COVID-19 vaccines 
in comparison with Russian and Chinese vaccines, and our withdrawal 
from Afghanistan.


ch to connect them.
    We continue to see individuals here at home inspired by 
Jihadist ideologies, espoused by foreign terrorist 
organizations, like ISIS and al-Qaeda, what we would call 
``home-grown violent extremists''. But we are also countering 
lone domestic violent extremists, radicalized by personalized 
grievances, ranging from racial or ethnic bias to anti-
authority or anti-Government sentiment to conspiracy theories. 
There is no doubt about it, today's threat is different from 
what it was 20 years ago and it will most certainly continue to 
change.


 FBI Special Agents, Intelligence Analysts, and professional staff 
have been hard at work gathering evidence, sharing intelligence, and 
working with Federal prosecutors to bring charges against the 
individuals involved. As we have said consistently, we do not and will 
not tolerate violent extremists who use the guise of First Amendment-
protected activity to engage in violent criminal activity. Thus far, 
the FBI has arrested hundreds of individuals with regards to rioting, 
assault on a Federal officer, property crimes violations, and 
conspiracy charges, and the work continues. Overall, the FBI assesses 
that the January 6 siege of the Capitol Complex demonstrates a 
willingness by some to use violence against the Government in 
furtherance of their political and social goals. This ideologically-
motivated violence--domestic terrorism--underscores the symbolic nature 
of the National Capital Region and the willingness of some Domestic 
Violent Extremists to travel to events in this area and violently 
engage law enforcement and their perceived adversaries. The American 
people should rest assured that we will continue to work to hold 
accountable those individuals who participated in the violent breach of 
the Capitol on January 6 and any others who attempt to use violence to 
intimidate, coerce, or influence the American people or affect the 
conduct of our Government.


 The FBI remains concerned that FTOs, such as ISIS and al-Qaeda, 
intend to carry out or inspire large-scale attacks in the United 
States. As we saw in the murder in Kabul last month of 13 brave 
American service men and women and nearly 200 Afghans, ISIS remains 
relentless in its campaign of violence against the United States and 
our partners--both here at home and overseas. To this day, ISIS 
continues to aggressively promote its hate-fueled rhetoric and attract 
like-minded violent extremists with a willingness to conduct attacks 
against the United States and our interests abroad. ISIS' successful 
use of social media and messaging applications to attract individuals 
seeking a sense of belonging is of continued concern to us. Like other 
foreign terrorist groups, ISIS advocates for lone offender attacks in 
the United States and Western countries via videos and other English 
language propaganda that have at times specifically advocated for 
attacks against civilians, the military, law enforcement, and other 
Government personnel.
    Al-Qaeda maintains its desire to both conduct and inspire large-
scale, spectacular attacks. Because continued pressure has degraded 
some of the group's senior leadership, in the near term, we assess that 
al-Qaeda is more likely to continue to focus on cultivating its 
international affiliates and supporting small-scale, readily achievable 
attacks, including attacks against the interests of the United States 
and other Western nations, in regions such as East and West Africa. 
Over the past year, propaganda from al-Qaeda leaders continued to seek 
to inspire individuals to conduct attacks in the United States and 
other Western nations. We expect those attempts to continue.


 foreign malign influence
    Our Nation is confronting multifaceted foreign threats seeking to 
both influence our National policies and public opinion, and cause harm 
to our National dialog. The FBI and our interagency partners remain 
concerned about, and focused on, malign influence measures used by 
certain adversaries in their attempts to sway U.S. voters' preferences 
and perspectives, shift U.S. policies, increase discord in the United 
States, and undermine the American people's confidence in our 
democratic processes.
    Foreign malign influence operations--which include subversive, 
undeclared, coercive, and criminal actions by foreign governments to 
influence U.S. political sentiment or public discourse or interfere in 
our democratic processes themselves--are not a new problem. But the 
interconnectedness of the modern world, combined with the anonymity of 
the internet, have changed the nature of the threat and how the FBI and 
its partners must address it. Foreign malign influence operations have 
taken many forms and used many tactics over the years. Most widely 
reported these days are attempts by adversaries--hoping to reach a wide 
swath of Americans covertly from outside the United States--to use 
false personas and fabricated stories on social media platforms to 
discredit U.S. individuals and institutions.
    The FBI is the lead Federal agency responsible for investigating 
foreign malign influence operations. In the fall of 2017, we 
established the Foreign Influence Task Force (``FITF'') to identify and 
counteract malign foreign influence operations targeting the United 
States. The FITF is led by the Counterintelligence Division and is 
comprised of agents, analysts, and professional staff from the 
Counterintelligence, Cyber, Counterterrorism, and Criminal 
Investigative Divisions. It is specifically charged with identifying 
and combating foreign malign influence operations targeting democratic 
institutions and values inside the United States. In all instances, the 
FITF strives to protect democratic institutions; develop a common 
understanding of threats with our interagency partners; raise 
adversaries' costs; and disrupt foreign malign influence operations and 
enablers in the United States and world-wide.
    While we are keenly focused on threats to elections, those events 
are not the only aspects of our democracy that are being threatened. 
Our adversaries are also targeting the very fabric of our civil 
discourse and are targeting policy processes at every level of 
government--State, local, and Federal. The FITF brings the FBI's 
National security and traditional criminal investigative expertise 
under one umbrella to better understand and combat these complex and 
nuanced threats. This cross-programmatic approach allows the FBI to 
identify connections across programs, to aggressively investigate as 
appropriate, and--importantly--to be more agile. Coordinating closely 
with our partners and leveraging relationships we have developed in the 
technology sector, we regularly relay threat indicators that those 
companies use to take swift action, blocking budding abuse of their 
platforms.
    Following the 2018 mid-term elections, we reviewed the threat and 
the effectiveness of our coordination and outreach. As a result of this 
review, we further expanded the scope of the FITF. Previously, our 
efforts to combat foreign malign influence focused solely on the threat 
posed by Russia. Using lessons learned from the 2018 mid-term 
elections, the FITF widened its aperture to confront foreign malign 
operations of the P.R.C., Iran, and other global adversaries. To 
address this expanding focus and wider set of adversaries and influence 
efforts, we have also added resources to maintain permanent coverage of 
foreign malign influence threats, including threats to our elections.
    These additional resources were also devoted to working with U.S. 
Government partners on two documents regarding the U.S. Government's 
analysis of foreign efforts to influence or interfere with the 2020 
Election. The reports are separate but complementary and were published 
earlier this year. The first report--referred to as the 1a report and 
authored by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence--
outlines the intentions of foreign adversaries with regard to 
influencing and interfering with the election but does not evaluate 
impact. The second report--referred to as the 1b report and authored by 
the Department of Justice, including the FBI, and Department of 
Homeland Security, including CISA--evaluates the impact of foreign 
government activity on the security or integrity of election 
infrastructure or infrastructure pertaining to political organizations, 
candidates, or campaigns.
    The main takeaway from both reports is that there is no evidence--
not through intelligence collection on the foreign actors themselves, 
not through physical security and cybersecurity monitoring of voting 
systems across the country, not through post-election audits, and not 
through any other means--that a foreign government or other actors 
compromised election infrastructure to manipulate election results.
    Another way in which foreign governments reach across borders to 
influence and target diaspora communities in the United States is 
through ``transnational repression,'' which is the growing practice of 
governments silencing exiles and members of diasporas--including 
activists, dissidents, defectors, journalists, and other critics--
living outside of their territorial borders. Iran, the P.R.C., and 
other authoritarian regimes continue to target dissidents and human 
rights activists on U.S. soil. The administration is committed to 
addressing this challenge as part of our broader commitment to stem 
rising authoritarianism.
    We remain vigilant in understanding and combating foreign malign 
influence in the homeland and look across the U.S. Government--in our 
intelligence community partners and beyond--as we work to effectively 
protect our elections, democratic processes, and the American people.


Today, the most pressing terrorist threats to the homeland 
        come from individuals who are inspired to conduct acts of 
        violence, whether by FTOs or by ideologies that are more 
        domestic in nature. The threat from domestic violent extremists 
        (DVEs)--in particular, racially or ethnically motivated violent 
        extremists, or RMVEs, and militia violent extremists, or 
        MVEs,--has increased since 2015 and will most likely persist, 
        in part because the factors that underpin and aggravate their 
        motivations--like social polarization, negative perceptions 
        about immigration, conspiracy theories promoting violence, and 
        distrust of Government institutions--will probably endure. The 
        threat from home-grown violent extremists (HVEs) inspired by 
        groups like al-Qaeda or ISIS also remain a significant concern.


 Additionally, ISIS probably maintains the intent to conduct 
external attacks through a variety of means, including by deploying 
attackers from the conflict zone, sending operational suggestions 
virtually to individuals in target countries, and inspiring supporters 
through their propaganda. Inspired attacks by ISIS supporters will most 
likely remain the primary ISIS threat to the United States and other 
Western countries. The group will almost certainly continue using its 
media to encourage supporters to carry out attacks without direction 
from ISIS leadership, but its degraded propaganda arm will likely 
hinder its ability to inspire its previous high pace of attacks and 
bring in new recruits. While we have seen a decline in the number of 
ISIS-inspired attacks in the West since peaking in 2017, such 
operations remain a priority for the organization.
    Outside Iraq and Syria, ISIS will most likely continue to grow its 
already robust global enterprise, which includes approximately 20 
branches and networks. Although these loyal outposts have varying 
levels of capability, they provide ISIS with launch points to plan and 
conduct attacks, recruit, and galvanize supporters and are a source of 
propaganda that helps sustain the movement. Many of the group's 
branches and networks continue to conduct local operations, which ISIS 
claims in media to dispel the narrative of its defeat. In particular, 
during the past year, ISIS has had success in growing its presence 
across large swaths of Africa, as demonstrated by ISIS-Mozambique's 
temporary seizure in March of a coastal town where foreign workers on 
the country's largest liquefied natural gas project resided. Notably, 
we have seen no sign of fissures or splintering by the branches and 
networks despite the fact that ISIS has not held territory in Iraq or 
Syria in more than 2 years.

ISIS and al-Qaeda both have branches and affiliates in Afghanistan 
that will require CT vigilance, especially in light of recent 
developments there. Both groups are intent on attacking U.S. interests 
both in the region and overseas, although years of sustained CT 
pressure has degraded their capabilities to project a major external 
threat to the West. Since the U.S. withdrawal, we have continued to 
closely monitor for any signs of terrorist plotting that targets the 
United States or our interests abroad. Over the longer term, we suspect 
these groups could try to take advantage of reduced counterterrorism 
pressure and a relatively more permissive operating environment to 
rebuild their capacity to carry out attacks against Western targets. 
ISIS-Khorasan maintains a steady operational tempo in Afghanistan and 
retains the ability to execute attacks in cities like Kabul--as we saw 
tragically on 26 August. While focused against the Taliban, the group's 
external intentions bear monitoring. Similarly, we continue to closely 
watch the activities of al-Qaeda elements in the region because of the 
group's close ties to the Taliban and its propaganda against the West. 
After the withdrawal, the group released an official statement 
congratulating the Taliban for what it called a defeat of the United 
States. On September 11 this year, al-Qaeda released a video of group 
leader Ayman al-Zawahiri praising the Pensacola attacker and claiming 
that the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan proved that the United States 
was defeated.


 Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Secretary, I would 
like to start by thanking you too for your work to extend the 
TPS for citizens for several countries. This was something I 
asked you about the last time you were here. We looked at El 
Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. This is a large part of my 
district, which is the most diverse in Nevada, and one of the 
most diverse in the country. So, we certainly appreciate your 
recognizing the importance of that TPS and thank you for that 
extension.
    Well, you have heard a lot about the concern about the 
Haitians at the border and I would like to expand on that. But 
I would like to go back to where they came from. We know that 
the cartels and some of these people who prey on the immigrants 
have taken their money. They have sold their possessions. They 
have come up here. Could you describe how your Department in 
this kind-of all-of-Government approach is working with the 
State Department and maybe with NGO's in some of the countries 
of origin to counter this false information or to deal with 
these people who are preying on folks who just want a better 
life?
    Secretary Mayorkas. Congresswoman, thank you so much. Your 
point goes directly to something the Congressman who preceded 
your question addressed, which is these individuals, vulnerable 
individuals, are being exploited by smuggling organizations and 
are receiving false information with respect to the border. We 
are in collaboration with the Department of State and other 
agencies within the Government countering that false 
information, that false messaging both from the United States 
and in the countries of origin themselves.


 Bloomington, Minnesota, September 13, 2021 (DoJ/U.S. Attorney's 
Office for the District of Minnesota).--Emily Claire Hari, 50, f/k/a 
Michael Hari, was sentenced to 53 years in prison for the August 5, 
2017, bombing of the Dar al-Farooq (DAF) Islamic Center. Hari was 
convicted by a Federal jury on all 5 counts of the indictment, 
including intentionally defacing, damaging, and destroying religious 
property because of the religious character of that property; 
intentionally obstructing, and attempting to obstruct, by force and the 
threat of force, the free exercise of religious beliefs; conspiracy to 
commit Federal felonies by means of fire and explosives; carrying and 
using a destructive device during and in relation to crimes of 
violence; and possession of an unregistered destructive device. As 
proven at trial, during the summer of 2017, Hari established a 
terrorist militia group called ``The White Rabbits'' in Clarence, 
Illinois. Hari recruited co-defendants Michael McWhorter and Joe Morris 
to join the militia, which Hari outfitted with paramilitary equipment 
and assault rifles. On August 4 and 5, 2017, Hari, McWhorter, and 
Morris drove in a rented pickup truck from Illinois to Bloomington, 
Minnesota, to bomb the DAF Islamic Center, using a 20-pound black 
powder pipe bomb together with a plastic container filled with a 
mixture of diesel fuel and gasoline. When the pipe bomb exploded, the 
blast caused extensive damage to the Imam's office. It also ignited the 
gasoline and diesel mixture, causing extensive fire and smoke damage. 
At the time of the bombing, several worshipers were gathered in the 
mosque for morning prayers. Hari targeted DAF specifically to terrorize 
Muslims into believing they are not welcome in the United States and 
should leave the country. In handing down a 53-year sentence, United 
States District Judge Donovan W. Frank described the attack 
orchestrated by Hari as a highly sophisticated and premeditated act of 
domestic terrorism.


 Germany, September 3, 2021 (The Algemeiner).--Germany's president 
Frank-Walter Steinmeier delivered a Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year) 
message to Germany's Jewish community filled with concern for the 
community's safety and security. Steinmeier remarked that 2 years after 
the Halle atrocity, ``Jews in Germany continue to be ridiculed, 
belittled, violently attacked.'' On October 9, 2019, neo-Nazi Stephan 
Balliet drove to the Halle synagogue as more than 50 worshipers inside 
the sanctuary held services to mark Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the 
Jewish calendar. Balliet was equipped with eight firearms, several 
explosive devices, a helmet, and a protective vest for the attack. 
After failing to break through the synagogue's locked entrance despite 
exploding a grenade, Balliet shot dead a 40-year-old female passerby. 
After additional violent attempts to force his way inside the temple, 
Balliet drove to a Muslim-owned restaurant and shot dead a 20-year-old 
man he believed to be a Muslim. According to German Federal Government 
figures released in February, at least 2,275 crimes with an anti-
Semitic background were logged over a 12-month period ending in January 
2021. Steinmeier asserted that anti-Semitic conspiracy theories fueled 
by the COVID-19 pandemic were gaining momentum. ``It pains me and makes 
me angry that anti-Semitic hatred and anti-Jewish agitation are showing 
themselves so openly--in Germany, of all places,'' the president said.

",Addressing Misinformation and Threats to Homeland Security,"In response to ongoing homeland security challenges, including domestic terrorism, cyber threats, and the impact of the Taliban's return in Afghanistan, the U.S. government and relevant agencies are focusing on combating misinformation campaigns that exploit vulnerable individuals seeking entry into the country. Various groups, such as human traffickers and smuggling organizations, propagate false narratives to encourage migration, posing security risks and straining resources. The administration's efforts involve collaborative measures with international partners to counter misinformation and enhance border security, aiming to safeguard national interests and democratic institutions against external threats."

 The House passed reforms to make this possible 105 days ago 
in the HEROES Act, including $3.6 billion in funding for 
nationwide implementation. Unfortunately, Senate Majority 
Leader McConnell has refused to take up the legislation, 
refusing instead to delay and do nothing for months. The virus, 
however, has not delayed, nor has it simply disappeared. And, 
sadly, neither has the President's disinformation campaign 
against voting, especially absentee voting.


 The bill would also require the Postal Service to treat all 
election mail as first-class mail, as has been its practice for 
years. And it will provide the $25 billion in much-needed 
funding that its board of governors--each governor appointed by 
President Trump himself--has requested.
    Still, the President continues to spread disinformation and 
falsehoods about the safety and security of voting. They do not 
bear repeating at a congressional hearing.


 STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE ALEX PADILLA

    Mr. Padilla. Well, thank you, Chairperson Lofgren, Ranking 
Member Davis, and members of the Committee, for the opportunity 
to address you today.
    I want to talk about the two greatest threats to a free, 
fair, and safe election this November: the COVID-19 pandemic 
and election disinformation.
    California held its primary on March 3 of this year, and 
our first COVID-19 emergency declaration was issued the very 
next day. We soon began to hear from local officials that many 
of the polling places and poll workers that we were depending 
on for the November election were backing out. And as we 
listened to Federal and State health officials, it quickly 
became clear that we would need to modify how we administer the 
general election if we were to keep the election accessible, 
secure, and safe.


 The other threat I mentioned is election disinformation. 
Baseless attacks on the integrity of our elections pose a 
serious danger to the health of our citizens and our democracy. 
Disinformation, amplified and often initiated by President 
Trump, about vote-by-mail, ballot drop boxes, and more 
undermines public confidence.
    Numerous reports and court decisions have found that voter 
fraud is rare and isolated. To quote U.S. District Court Judge 
Julie Robinson of Kansas, ``The rare known cases of voter fraud 
were not the tip of the iceberg. There is no iceberg, only an 
icicle, largely created by confusion and administrative 
error.''


 I have been working elections for 20 years. I have overseen 
polling places, the transition to all-mail, and now manage 
elections for one of the largest vote-by-mail counties in the 
country.
    I would like to start this morning by addressing some 
misinformation about vote-by-mail that has been circulating of 
late.
    First, voting by mail is secure. Before we moved to vote-
by-mail, we managed 8,000 poll workers across as many as 700 
polling locations. Now, we process every single ballot at one 
location, our secure headquarters. Not only does this limit 
risk, it means I can directly oversee the entire operation. It 
means we can track and reconcile every ballot. And it means the 
public and observers have complete transparency. All of our 
elections staff are highly trained paid employees who swear to 
uphold the sanctity of the election.
    Second, voter fraud is almost nonexistent. While we have 
seen many claims, often fueled by speculation and little 
evidence, the reality is that we have many safeguards to 
prevent fraud. We ensure accurate voter rolls by working with 
other States, the Department of Licensing, USPS, and the Social 
Security Administration.


I want to address a few key concerns that have come up 
recently.
    As noted in a CISA report released on July 31, and I quote, 
``Disinformation risk to mail-in voting infrastructure 
processes is similar to that of in-person voting while 
utilizing different content. Threat actors may leverage limited 
understanding regarding mail-in voting to mislead and confuse 
the public.''
    Now, this report is critical at highlighting not only an 
issue within the security of our elections but particularly as 
it relates to vote-by-mail, and this includes casting doubt, 
without evidence, about the mail ballot process. Thus, 
combating disinformation and misinformation is a critical 
aspect of election officials' work right now.


  Despite the best efforts of the Leadership Conference 
coalition to protect voting rights for vulnerable communities, 
voter suppression continues today to take its toll. What we 
have seen in this year's primary elections alone provides a 
dire warning of what we could expect in November without 
congressional action, from undelivered absentee ballots, to 
unreasonably long lines, to polling place closures, to 
undertrained staff, to disinformation campaigns that are 
specifically targeting voters of color.
    That is why lawmakers must act now to ensure that the 
general election is fair, safe, and accessible and support 
State and local election officials that are trying to do just 
this.
    First, it means taking immediate action to preserve the 
integrity of the Postal Service. The USPS is legally required 
to deliver mail to all postal addresses no matter how far it 
may have to travel or how profitable the work. The 
accessibility and affordability the USPS provides is crucial to 
seniors, people with disabilities, veterans, and rural and 
Tribal communities.
    In response to the alarming problems at the USPS and 
disinformation efforts to undermine voters' confidence in 
voting by mail from officials in the highest offices of the 
land, a bipartisan House majority passed the Delivering for 
America Act last weekend. This bill needs to be made into law. 
It would provide USPS with the $25 billion in emergency funding 
and restore services. And we are really encouraged by this 
important step to protect the U.S. Postal Service.


 And, lastly, there is a huge urgency to provide funds to 
States to be able to educate voters about all of the rule 
changes and combat disinformation.


 Mr. Raskin. Madam Chair, thank you very much.
    And I am actually greatly reassured by the testimony from 
our secretaries of State and these election officials that we 
are ready to go and we should stop spreading anxiety and 
disinformation about the elections.
    I confess that I am a little bit baffled by my friend, the 
Ranking Member's indignant complaint about the Democratic 
secretaries of State's completely unexceptional TV 
advertisement about White supremacy being both a political 
ideology and a strategy for maintaining power. One would think 
that the whole history of disenfranchisement in our country, 
with poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, White 
primaries, and so on, would vindicate the accuracy and the 
passion of that ad.
    And, indeed, when the gentleman repeatedly invokes ``over-
the-top rhetoric,'' I don't know what he is referring to. But 
it strikes me as over-the-top rhetoric to link this ad, 
presumably made over the last several months--I don't know; 
maybe the secretary from California could tell us--but linking 
that ad to the violent assault on our colleagues on June 4, 
2017, something that took place 3 years ago, that strikes me as 
true over-the-top rhetoric.
    In any event, we face two key obstacles today, as Secretary 
Padilla puts it. One is COVID-19; the other is the continuing 
disinformation about voting which is scaring people and 
confusing people. And there is this incessant stream of 
propaganda from the highest levels of government trying to 
scare people about different forms of voting.


 So vote-by-mail is absolutely convenient for voters. It has 
proven to be secure as well. You know, among the security 
measures that we have in place, starting with the ballots 
themselves, it is not quite like currency, but think specific 
paper types, watermarks, other distinguishing features of 
ballots. So it would be pretty darn hard to introduce fake 
ballots into the system. The alarm bells would go off almost 
immediately.


 Ms. Gupta. Thank you, sir, for the question.
    Six-hundred-and-seventy-one mail sorting machines were 
removed from 49 States in the last few months under Postmaster 
General DeJoy's leadership. And every sorting machine actually 
has the ability to process about 30,000 pieces of mail per 
hour. And so the refusal to restore them really gets to some of 
the functionality of a system that Americans rely on and are 
going to rely on now more than ever amid a pandemic, where 
surges of Americans will be voting by mail to protect our 
public health.
    And so there is a lot of concern that if the decommissioned 
machines and mailboxes are not restored that it could really 
undermine or slow down the system for voting by mail. It also 
has the potential to confuse voters, to add to disinformation.
    And so this is why there has been such an urgency to get 
these post mailboxes restored. You know, voters need to have 
confidence in the vote. There is also--there are the policy 
changes, and then there is the confidence that voters need. And 
amid so much disinformation, voters need to feel like the U.S. 
Postal Service is going to be a reliable service to vote by 
mail.


 The issue for this November is with so many other States 
ramping up vote-by-mail significantly, possibly for the first 
time. You know, think Michigan and Pennsylvania and Ohio, 
Arizona, and others. If the Presidential contest is too close 
to call on election night in enough key States, we may not know 
the final outcome for at least a few days.
    And our worry, going back to the disinformation that I 
spoke of during my testimony, is we are going to be hearing, 
you know, a lot of conspiracy theories and lies during that 
timeframe that threaten to undermine confidence in our 
elections.
    The public and the press need to understand this is simply 
the process at work. It is maintaining the integrity of the 
process. And it is better to be patient. We want to get the 
vote count right, not rush to get it fast.
    Mr. Aguilar. Yeah. And it is important to set those 
expectations now, and I appreciate it.
    For the life of me, I just can't understand why the Ranking 
Member spends so much time devoted to California elections laws 
and spreading his own misinformation about our processes. Maybe 
he wants to move to California. You know, that is something 
that is available to him as a private citizen in the future.


 The Chairperson. So I think it is important, all of us who 
are watching the North Carolina debacle--and that was, North 
Carolina does not permit voters to decide that they want their 
neighbor to take the ballot in. But there was a conspiracy, 
really, by political operatives who violated the law. They put 
in false applications for absentee ballots. They destroyed 
ballots. I mean--and they committed crimes, and they were 
prosecuted and convicted of those crimes.


",Battling Misinformation and Ensuring Election Integrity,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge election administration, Secretary Alex Padilla underscores the critical need for accurate information and preparedness. He highlights California's adaptations to ensure safe and secure elections amid the pandemic, debunking myths about vote-by-mail security and voter fraud. Padilla emphasizes the importance of combating election disinformation, which undermines public confidence and poses a significant threat to democracy. Furthermore, he calls for urgent action to address postal service issues and provide funding for election education and infrastructure. However, amidst calls for action, there are concerns about disinformation campaigns and attempts to sow doubt in election results. Representatives stress the importance of preserving election integrity and combating voter suppression, while urging transparency and patience in the vote-counting process. Despite partisan divides, the focus remains on safeguarding the democratic process and ensuring that every vote is counted accurately."

 Last year's election was the most litigated Presidential 
election in our history, with hundreds of lawsuits being filed 
before and after election day. States adopted policies and 
procedures to provide safe voting options in the midst of the 
pandemic. Election officials conducted high-turnout elections 
through hurricanes, wildfires, social unrest, and active 
cybersecurity threats. Throughout these unprecedented 
circumstances, our country's election system remained 
resilient.
    One portion of the electorate is concerned that laws passed 
by State legislatures will disenfranchise voters who struggled 
to participate last year. Rampant misinformation and 
disinformation in 2020 tore at the fabric of our democracy and 
shattered confidence in our elections with another portion of 
the electorate.


Ms. Scanlon. Thank you. Can you dispel some of the 
misinformation about the security of ballot drop boxes?
    Ms. Johnson-Blanco. Yes. There have been studies done after 
the election, looking at the allegations related to mail-in 
voting, and have found that those allegations of fraud or 
mischief were unfounded. I think that the jurisdictions that 
have used drop boxes have actually allowed opportunities for 
voters to submit their ballots in a timely manner. And there 
hasn't been any evidence that there were any security flaws in 
being able to do so.",Safeguarding the Integrity of Elections Amidst Challenges,"Despite facing unprecedented challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, and cybersecurity threats, the U.S. election system demonstrated resilience during the 2020 Presidential election, which was the most litigated in history. While some concerns about disenfranchisement persist due to new state laws and misinformation, experts assert that measures like ballot drop boxes have proven secure and effective, dispelling unfounded allegations of fraud. This highlights the importance of maintaining confidence in the electoral process and addressing misinformation to uphold democracy."

 The Chairman. This hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee on the State of Democracy in Latin America and the 
Caribbean will now commence.
    Today we continue our series on the state of democracy in 
the world with a focus on the Americas. This year, we will 
celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Inter-American Democratic 
Charter, the groundbreaking manifestation of consensus in our 
Hemisphere that, ``the peoples of the Americas have a right to 
democracy, and their governments have an obligation to promote 
and defend it.'' Over the past 2 decades, we and our neighbors 
have endeavored to deepen our commitment to democratic 
governance, even as significant backsliding has occurred. 
Indeed, we in this very chamber are all too aware, as the 
fencing comes down around the Capitol Complex this week, that 
democracy can be fragile and requires vigilance. Autocrats and 
populists alike have borrowed tactics from the same play book, 
dismantling constitutional checks on power, attacking a free 
press, closing space for civil society, and using 
disinformation to sow discord and undermine citizens' trust in 
government.


The Nicaraguan case is a case that needs an urgent and 
immediate electoral reform. We have done so in Honduras. We 
still have to improve a lot the way the Honduras democracy 
electoral process work. We are working with Haiti, too, in 
order to improve their electoral process, and we have to face 
extreme cases. Bolivia was an extreme case with significant 
irregularities. Election observers were essential. The 
electoral fraud in Bolivia represented a paradigmatic example 
of ill intention and bad practices with the goal of 
manipulating the electoral outcome. Definitely we can go 
through all the irregularities we found, including irregular 
servers--illicit servers, false information, tally sheets 
filled with irregular form, plus 20-something more 
irregularities.


 Misinformation and disinformation is also another topic in 
our--in our democracies. We are now in the preparatory phase of 
the Ninth Summit of the Americas, again, under the presidency 
of the United States. As we are entering the preparatory phase, 
it is evident that the recovery of the region in its health, 
economic, and social aspects will be very much at the center of 
our concerns, as well as the consequences on democratic values 
and practices in the region on this 20th anniversary of the 
Inter-Democratic Charter. Thank you very much.


 The situation in Bolivia was an extreme case. With significant 
irregularities, election observers were essential. The electoral fraud 
in Bolivia in 2019 represented a paradigmatic example of ill-
intentioned bad practices with the goal of manipulating the electoral 
outcome. Among other irregularities all of the following were observed:

    Weakening of the electoral authority; intentional stoppage of the 
Preliminary Results Transmission System (TREP); clandestine servers, 
hidden server manipulation; use of a parallel technological scheme for 
improper purposes, improper remote logins into the system; access of 
unauthorized persons to the system; supplying of false information and 
deliberate attempt to hide server; false information regarding servers 
used; malicious and irregular filling of tally sheets; burning of 
electoral materials; the metadata of the TREP images was not preserved; 
the hash value was not recorded in the software freezing act and 
modifications to it were later made in the middle of the electoral 
process, irregularities in handling of foreign acts; residuals of 
databases and the NEOTEC application were found in perimeter servers; 
unexplained and unauthorized entries to the system, the person in 
charge of the NEOTEC company modified the Official Computation (Computo 
Oficial) software during the process on more than one occasion; at 
least 1,575 tally sheets of the TREP (environment whose network was 
violated and manipulated) entered directly into the Official Count; 
through SQL statements (which allow data to be changed without using 
the application) the database was accessed to resolve flaws in a 
calculation algorithm; there was no adequate preservation of the 
evidence on the election; the poor chain of custody did not guarantee 
that the electoral material had not been tampered with and/or replaced, 
original voting records from abroad (unfilled) were found at the TSE 
facilities; and the authentication for the use of the tally (computo) 
system software was weak and allowed someone to take control with 
administration roles.


  Misinformation and disinformation also affect our politics and 
governance in a manner like that of technology in elections because it 
involves many of the same tools. New technologies have disrupted how we 
relate and interact with one another, inspiring democratic revolutions 
while also providing means for surveillance and the amplifying of 
misinformation.
    Misinformation is not so much a question of fact versus fiction, 
but one of false narratives. These stories are created to install 
doubt. Doubt about the facts, doubts about democracy, its institutions, 
and the work of politicians. And there is only one aim; the erosion of 
public trust and confidence.
    The problem is that people are not, in fact, fighting against the 
use of these false narratives. Instead, the other side is adapting 
these tools and practices for their own ends and countering with their 
own messaging and what we are faced with is a perpetual fight between 
competing narratives. Further, these tools and techniques are being 
industrialized, and troll farms and bots are used to pump out comments 
and amplify the scale and profile of their preferred storyline to 
unprecedented levels.


 Ms. Ullmer. Thank you, Chairman Menendez and Ranking Member 
Risch. Thank you for this opportunity to address the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee on the State of Democracy in Latin 
America and the Caribbean. My name is Deborah Ullmer, and I am 
the regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean 
programs at the National Democratic Institute.
    NDI is dedicated to strengthening democratic governance, 
practices, and institutions globally, and has worked in the 
region for nearly 35 years. Like our Republican counterpart, 
the International Republican Institute, NDI works with civic 
groups, government officials, legislators, and political 
parties across the political spectrum at the national and local 
levels on issues such as citizen security, election integrity, 
accountability and transparency, dialogue on political reform, 
and combating disinformation. Since the adoption of the Inter-
American Democratic Charter almost 20 years ago, numerous 
challenges to democratic governments have emerged, including a 
rise in authoritarian leaders and an increased preference for 
populist leaders, challenges to electoral integrity by 
governments that bend the rules of the game in their favor and 
infuse political financing from narco-traffickers, and a 
prevalence of disinformation and illiberal influences.


 The organization I represent--the National Democratic Institute 
(NDI)--is dedicated to strengthening democratic governance, practices 
and institutions globally. NDI has worked in Latin America and the 
Caribbean for nearly 35 years, supported by several international 
assistance organizations, including the United States Agency for 
International Development, the National Endowment for Democracy, the 
State Department Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, the 
Swedish International Development Assistance Agency, Global Affairs 
Canada, Open Society Foundation, Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and the Howard G. Buffett Foundation. Today, NDI has six national 
offices in Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras and Mexico. We 
regularly engage other countries in regional programs on citizen 
security, election integrity, accountability and transparency, dialogue 
on political reform and combating disinformation. Our work with civic 
groups, government officials, legislators and political parties from 
all political persuasions, at national and local levels, exposes us 
daily to diverse perspectives, spanning senior political leaders to 
grassroots activists, and informs the observations that follow.


 key trends and ways to address them
    On September 11, 2021, the Organization of American States (OAS) 
will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the groundbreaking Inter-
American Democratic Charter. Since the Charter's adoption, there have 
been numerous challenges to democratic governance--including a rise in 
authoritarian and populist leaders--questioned elections, democracy not 
delivering, entrenched corruption and a growing prevalence of 
misinformation and disinformation and illiberal influences. The 
severity of the COVID-19 pandemic compounded long-standing social and 
economic inequalities, and magnified democratic and human rights 
challenges. Post-pandemic economic recovery and unequal vaccine rollout 
efforts may further fuel unrest in the region and open possibilities 
for more populism. Social mobilization in recent history has 
demonstrated that there is a popular outpouring on the need for change, 
but there is no consensus on what their future should look like. 
Additionally, the magnitude of migration movements due to crime, 
corruption, impunity, poverty, climate change and other vulnerabilities 
is creating humanitarian crises in the region.


 Election observers in cooperation with independent media and 
electoral authorities need to continue to develop techniques to respond 
more effectively to newer challenges to electoral integrity.\11\ The 
challenges include the growing reach of disinformation spread through 
social media to advance political goals, and hacking for political 
espionage and even sabotage of electoral information systems. NDI has 
worked with civil society and electoral authorities in Colombia, 
Ecuador and Mexico to help identify, track and counter disinformation. 
NDI is also working with civic groups in El Salvador and Mexico to 
monitor online electoral and political violence against women 
candidates.


Ms. Ullmer. Sure. So for press freedom, and the protection 
of journalists: I would say protection of all reform-minded 
persons working within government and outside of government is 
really number one to ensure that they are safe in what they are 
doing. That includes providing security training, providing 
cybersecurity training, and, unfortunately, sometimes 
protecting them as witnesses as they are trying to get their 
information out. Many times, the journalists will now pair up 
with international journalists on important corruption events 
to protect their lives, so that is important.
    And another area to work on with press freedom is 
disinformation. As you know, there is a prevalence of 
disinformation. And so nowadays, NDI and other organizations 
like ours are working with electoral authorities and other 
government officials, with Facebook, with Microsoft, with 
Twitter, on how to detect disinformation and to combat it. 
Specifically, we have been dealing with disinformation against 
violence against women political candidates in countries like 
Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, and El Salvador. So, I think those 
are important initiatives. Thank you, Senator.


 Ms. Ullmer. Thank you, Senator. It is concerning what is 
happening in Brazil, and, particularly, the rhetoric. Brazil, 
as you know, represents one of the largest democracies in the 
hemisphere. The rule of law, protection of the environment with 
the Amazons, COVID-19, and restrictions that have been placed 
on the population and then lifted rapidly, and disinformation 
surrounding COVID in Brazil, are all concerning. Democracy is 
fragile in Latin America, and when you have the largest 
democracies backslide and their future looks grim, these are 
all very concerning trends. And the U.S. should probably focus 
more on helping look at issues of democratic governance in 
terms of the environment and others that affect the hemisphere 
and engage in that regard. Thank you.
",Safeguarding Democracy in Latin America and the Caribbean,"The Senate Foreign Relations Committee convened to discuss the state of democracy in Latin America and the Caribbean, particularly focusing on challenges and threats faced by democratic institutions in the region. The 20th anniversary of the Inter-American Democratic Charter serves as a backdrop to assess progress and setbacks in democratic governance. Examples such as the Nicaraguan electoral reform, challenges in Honduras and Haiti, and the extreme case of electoral fraud in Bolivia underscore the urgency of addressing issues related to election integrity and disinformation. Witnesses highlighted the role of organizations like the National Democratic Institute (NDI) in promoting democracy and combating disinformation through collaboration with electoral authorities, media, and tech companies. Concerns were raised about the rise of authoritarianism, populism, and disinformation, emphasizing the need for international support to protect press freedom, strengthen electoral integrity, and safeguard democratic values in the region."

            (1) Finding.--Congress finds that the United States Agency 
        for Global Media (referred to in this section as ``USAGM'')

            (5) Radio free europe/radio liberty.--

                Europe/Radio Liberty (referred to in this section as

                    (A) Finding.--Congress finds that Radio Free Asia

                        efforts to counter social media tools,

                        promote misinformation;
                            (ii) expand digital programming and local 
                        coverage to expose China's media manipulation 
                        techniques; and
                            (iii) increase English language content to 
                        help counter China's propaganda directed toward

                Broadcasting Networks operate largely in closed media 
                markets in which malign state and nonstate actors

                and Digital Communications Network engaged journalists 
                around the world to combat COVID-19 disinformation, 
                promote unbiased reporting, and strengthen media

                that the Global Engagement Center should continue its 
                efforts to expose and counter state and non-state-
                sponsored disinformation related to COVID-19, the 
                origins of COVID-19, and COVID-19 vaccinations.",Public Diplomacy and Global Health Response Act,"The Public Diplomacy and Global Health Response Act addresses the need for effective communication and information dissemination in combating COVID-19 misinformation and promoting global health initiatives.

    As infections threaten to spiral out of control, President 
Trump has tried to downplay the impact of COVID-19, calling 99 
percent of cases totally harmless, even as more than 130,000 
Americans have died and many more have become seriously ill. 
Just this week, he falsely claimed the U.S. coronavirus death 
rate is the lowest in the world when, in fact, it is among the 
highest. Unfortunately, the President's comments come as no 
surprise.
    His administration's response to the coronavirus has been 
an abject failure by any reasonable measure. He ignored early 
intelligence on the virus, continues to disregard the opinions 
of doctors and scientists, including those in his own 
administration, and perpetuates misinformation about COVID-19 
rather than allowing the experts to speak directly to the 
American people about the disease.


   As infections threaten to spiral out of control, President Trump

cases ``totally harmless'' even as more than 130,000 Americans have

  In Tupelo, for example, by executive order, we recently instituted 
a mandate to wear masks or face coverings at indoor businesses. The 
request for our city to mandate this policy was made by the North 
Mississippi Medical Center, our Nation's largest rural hospital, which 
is based in Tupelo, Mississippi, and the Tupelo Economic Recovery Task 
Force--a bi-partisan group of approximately 40 business and community 
leaders in our city. While it appears that the majority of our citizens 
support and are in voluntary compliance with the executive order, a 
sizable number of people in our area are adamantly opposed to masks or 
face coverings for a number of reasons, none of which are science-
based. The opposition is largely based upon conspiracy theories and 
what appears to be unofficial right-wing political propaganda. Many 
people appear to be of the belief that COVID-19 is simply a hoax 
designed to hurt the President politically. The President has an 
obligation as the leader of our Nation in both words and deeds to 
dispel these rumors and encourage our citizens to take every precaution 
to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
    Because of these unchecked conspiracy theories and rumors, local 
leaders have an increasingly difficult time enacting common-sense 
measures to protect both the health of their citizens and their local 
economies. That compounds the needs of local governments which I am 
here to speak of today.


 As we continue to face this virus, we cannot forget where 
it originated. Chinese obstruction and outright lies to the 
media and to international investigators are at the root cause 
of this virus and allowed it to spread onto a global scale. It 
remains critical that we are vigilant to the threat from China 
and act together as a committee to respond to any increased 
cyber attacks or other threats to our homeland while we 
continue to fight this coronavirus.


 Mr. Shelton. The President of the United States needs to 
get on TV and have a call to unity, that he needs to dispel the 
conspiracy theories and the rumors that are hampering the 
efforts of government at all levels to respond. We need both 
parties in the House and Senate to continue to work on 
legislation that is going to get help where help is needed.


  I would note, though, that in the Republicans' defense of 
the President, I haven't heard any of them mention, defend, or 
ask about the President's rallies in Tulsa, at Mt. Rushmore, 
and his future planned ones and how they put an extra burden on 
first responders, hospitals, and FEMA folks. I wonder if they 
believe the President when he says 99 percent of the cases are 
totally harmless and have that misinformation placed into the 
mixed message that the public is getting that stymies our 
attempts to get over this.


 Gov. Abbott delays further reopenings and orders hospitals in the 4 
hardest-hit counties to postpone elective surgeries to make way for 
COVID patients. That night, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick appears on National 
television to assure viewers that the State is not reversing course or 
running out of intensive care hospital beds. ``We have seen a spike in 
cases. We expected that,'' Patrick says, pointing falsely to increased 
testing.


 President Trump's pursuit of anti-science policy has been so 
effective that as the first cases of COVID-19 were breaking out in 
Wuhan, China, no meaningful science policy infrastructure was in place 
to advise him. As a consequence, America is suffering from a pandemic 
without a plan. Our responses are ineffectual and inconsistent. We are 
increasingly divided by misinformation and invidious messaging. And 
it's not even over.

When it came to testing, President Trump did not just say 
he took no responsibility at all, he said he liked the numbers 
where they were. He said he wanted to slow down testing, and he 
blamed testing for the rising case numbers.
    When it came to wearing masks, he not only said that masks 
caused problems too, he also shared a tweet saying masks 
represent a culture of silence, slavery, and social death, and 
a video falsely claiming people do not need to wear masks and 
there is no cure.
    He made false claims on treatments as well, continuing to 
promote hydroxychloroquine and has suggested we look at bleach 
as an option.
    And he is still--still--downplaying this virus. He is still 
saying it will just go away. He is saying we are, quote, 
rounding the final turn. Dr. Fauci has made it clear that is 
not true and pointed out that we have plateaued at around 
40,000 cases a day, that daily deaths are still regularly 
around 1,000, and experts have warned that we still need to 
prepare for a fall wave that will coincide with the flu season. 
But President Trump has not been listening to the public health 
experts. He has been fighting them, suggesting FDA is part of a 
deep state conspiracy, and CDC is overstating the death counts.


 Dr. Redfield. Absolutely, Senator. And I want to make a 
comment that not only is not true, it deeply saddened me when I 
read those comments because, as I said in my statement, CDC is 
made up of thousands of dedicated men and women highly 
competent--it is the premier public health agency in the 
world--dedicated 24/7 to use their skills to protect the 
American public and the world from the health issues. And it 
deeply saddened me that those false accusations were made by a 
group of really unbelievably professional people that serve 
this Nation.


 SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY

    Admiral Giroir, on the same issue, you are among HHS's top 
health officials. What are you doing to protect scientific 
integrity of the work done by the scientists and public health 
experts at CDC, HRSA, and NIH from political interference?
    Admiral Giroir. Part of my job as the senior scientific 
advisor to the Secretary is to make sure that he gets the best 
science and the best evidence base that is unfiltered. I do 
that every single day. I work with Bob Redfield. I work with 
Bob Kadlec. Francis Collins and I are on speed dials; Tom 
Engels, very, very important with HRSA. So you have my 
commitment, as you always have, Senator, that I will provide 
the best advice to the decision-makers that will be based on 
science and evidence, and that is the way we are going to 
operate going forward.
    Senator Murray. But can you right now reject the unfounded, 
harmful conspiracy theory that career professional leadership 
of CDC or any of our public health agencies have, quote, deep 
state ulterior motives that compromise their ability to act in 
the best interest of public health, as other Trump political 
appointees have claimed? Can you reject that? Yes or no.
    Admiral Giroir. I have not seen anything out of CDC, HRSA, 
any of the agencies I work with that is anything but people 
acting in the best interest of the American people. I have 
certainly not seen anything that you described.
    Senator Blunt. Thank you, Senator Murray.
    Senator Alexander.
    Senator Alexander. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thanks to 
the witnesses for coming.


Question. Admiral Giroir, even though the Chinese have not yet 
developed a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine, they have already 
started a so-called charm offensive to provide access to a Chinese 
vaccine to pro-Chinese nations as well as using it to repair damaged 
diplomatic ties with other nations. What steps are we taking to counter 
China's aggressive COVID-diplomacy? And how is the Department working 
with USAID and the State Department on the international response?
    Answer. HHS is working with other countries in the Indo-Pacific and 
around the world to communicate U.S. values and to highlight successful 
COVID-19 responses among friendly nations. Most significantly, in 
August, Secretary Azar became the highest ranking Cabinet Secretary to 
travel to Taiwan since the U.S. established diplomatic relations with 
the People's Republic of China in 1979. His trip emphasized U.S. 
support for Taiwan's role as a leader in COVID-19 response, as 
evidenced by their transparent and highly effective evidence based 
COVID-19 response and Taiwan's ability to access a COVID-19 vaccine 
when a safe and effective vaccine becomes available. HHS also has been 
working through regional bodies in Asia to support other like-minded 
country responses and to counter Chinese narratives that falsely assert 
their leadership in the global response to COVID-19. Misinformation and 
disinformation have been serious problems throughout the pandemic, 
especially regarding the development of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. 
The urgent need exists to address and manage COVID-19 misinformation 
and disinformation, and to continuously dispel myths and re-assert 
facts with evidence.",Upholding Scientific Integrity Amid Political Interference,"This exchange between Senator Murray and Admiral Giroir highlights concerns about political interference in public health agencies, particularly regarding the integrity of scientific work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Senator Murray criticizes President Trump's statements and actions regarding testing, mask-wearing, and treatments, accusing him of downplaying the virus and undermining public health experts. Dr. Redfield expresses his disappointment at false accusations against CDC professionals and emphasizes the agency's dedication to public health. Senator Murray questions Admiral Giroir about protecting scientific integrity from political interference, to which he reaffirms his commitment to providing evidence-based advice. In response to Senator Alexander's question, Admiral Giroir discusses efforts to counter China's COVID-19 diplomacy by highlighting successful responses among friendly nations and dispelling Chinese narratives regarding global leadership in the pandemic response."

enactment of this Act, the Director of the National Science Foundation 
shall enter into an arrangement with the National Academies of Science, 
Engineering, and Medicine (National Academies) to conduct a study on 
the current understanding of the spread of COVID-19-related 
disinformation on the internet and social media platforms. The study 
shall address the following:
            (1) the role disinformation and misinformation has played 
        in the public response to COVID-19;
            (2) the sources of COVID-19-related disinformation--both 
        foreign and domestic--and the mechanisms by which that 
        disinformation influences the public debate;
            (3) the role social media plays in the dissemination and 
        promotion of COVID-19 disinformation and misinformation content 
        and the role social media platforms play in the organization of 
        groups seeking to spread COVID-19 disinformation;
            (4) the potential financial returns for creators or 
        distributors of COVID-19 disinformation, and the role such 
        financial incentives play in the propagation of COVID-19 
        disinformation;
            (5) potential strategies to mitigate the dissemination and 
        negative impacts of COVID-19 disinformation, including 
        specifically, the dissemination of disinformation on social 
        media, including through improved disclosures; and
            (6) an analysis of the limitations of these mitigation 
        strategies, and an analysis of how these strategies can be 
        implemented without infringing on Americans' Constitutional

 It was apparent the Federal Government needed to do more 
work to provide critical resources directly to our first 
responders and State and local government, which is why 
Congress created the State Homeland Security Program and Urban 
Area Security Initiative Program, along with other grant 
programs. These programs have proven to be critical resources 
over the last 2 decades. While State and local governments have 
made great strides in their preparedness capabilities, we must 
recognize that the threat landscape is ever-evolving and the 
threats we now face have expanded considerably, to include 
rising incidents of domestic terrorism to cyber attacks. As the 
threats to our Nation continue to evolve, so too must the 
Homeland Security Preparedness Grant Program.

to include rising incidents of domestic terrorism to cyber attacks. As 
the threats to our Nation continue to evolve, so too must the homeland

  Cybersecurity is the No. 1 growing threat to the Nation's critical 
infrastructure. This is especially concerning for the State of Hawai'i 
as the largest combatant command with all its service components reside 
in the Island of Oahu. A cyber attack could against Hawai'i's critical 
infrastructure could impact USINDOPACOM's mission assurance.
    Over the past 2 years, both the Trump and Biden administrations 
have tried to better prioritize cybersecurity investment via carve-outs 
in FEMA grant programs. We appreciate and share DHS's renewed focus on 
cybersecurity to include resiliency, workforce development, modernized 
systems, and collaboration. But, to accomplish this fully, Governors 
believe that carve-outs can only go so far; dedicated funds that 
incentivize economies of scale are needed to be most effective.


 Since the beginning of the pandemic we witnessed humanity 
and kindness in our society. Unfortunately, on January 6 there 
was also an unacceptable attack on our democracy and its 
institutions resulting in the culmination of an existing 
domestic threat that has been pervasive in our country for some 
time.
    New Jersey's analytical capabilities have focused on 
domestic extremism and the threat it presents. We were one of 
the first States in the Nation to sharpen focus on groups in 
the United States perpetuating extreme ideologies meant to 
motivate individuals to violent action. We observed that COVID-
19 restrictions, disinformation, and misinformation would 
converge with the 2020 Presidential election and mounting civil 
unrest Nation-wide. Specifically, we saw domestic extremists, 
foreign terrorist organizations, and nation-state threat actors 
attempting to leverage disinformation to hinder economic 
recovery and vaccination efforts, fuel anti-Government 
sentiment, and spread false narratives to sow discord 
throughout the United States.
    In response we increased our efforts, beginning in March 
2020, to combat these inaccuracies and provide up-to-date 
information and guidance to the public. In September we 
released the threat assessment detailing how the convergence of 
COVID-19 pandemic, civil unrest, and the Presidential election 
influenced the National threat landscape.


 NJOHSP observed that COVID-19 restrictions, disinformation, and 
misinformation would converge with the 2020 Presidential election and

extremists, foreign terrorist organizations, and nation-state threat 
actors attempting to leverage disinformation to hinder economic

response, NJOHSP increased its efforts beginning in March 2020 to 
combat these inaccuracies and provide up-to-date knowledge and guidance 
from trusted authorities to help navigate the sheer volume of 
inaccurate information.


 In September, NJOHSP released its 2020-2021 Supplemental Threat 
Assessment, which detailed how the convergence of the COVID-19 
pandemic, civil unrest, and 2020 Presidential election influenced the 
National threat landscape. The analysis highlighted how evolving 
security threats would continue to impact New Jersey and the United 
States for the remainder of 2020 and through 2021. The following 
predictive analysis was forecasted:
   The COVID-19 pandemic and polarizing sentiments surrounding 
        its impact would worsen the convergence of the 2020 
        Presidential election and mounting civil unrest across the 
        Nation.
   Domestic extremists--primarily anarchist, anti-Government, 
        and racially motivated--would continue to manipulate National 
        incidents such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Presidential 
        election, and civil unrest to further their agendas and remain 
        a threat.
   Nation-state threat actors' expanding disinformation 
        campaigns that exploit COVID-19, election security, and civil 
        unrest would persist into 2021 to exacerbate domestic tensions 
        and challenge U.S. global credibility.


isdictions.
    Although today's hearings have focused on FEMA grants, a 
conversation of preparedness would not be complete without 
touching on some recent challenges. Over the past decade local 
law enforcement has become a public target for cyber attacks. 
We are lucky in Orlando to have a great chief information 
officer, Rosa Akhtarkhavari, that understands the seriousness 
of these threats and has taken steps to secure our city's 
systems. This is not always the case, as we have seen 
ransomware attacks in Atlanta and Baltimore.


  Over the past decade, law enforcement agencies have experienced an 
increase in cyber attacks by both criminal entities and 
``hacktivists.'' Considering their prominent public role and the 
sensitive information on their systems and networks, police 
departments, including many MCCA members, have become popular targets 
for ransomware, denial-of-service, and doxing attacks. As law 
enforcement relies more and more on technology systems to carry out its 
mission, these attacks can have catastrophic effects. For example, a 
ransomware attack could deny police officers access to critical records 
and investigative files, and denial-of-service attacks could take 9-1-1 
dispatch centers off-line, making it more difficult to get help to 
citizens in need. During the civil unrest that occurred throughout the 
summer of 2020, many MCCA members also struggled with having personnel 
and their families subjected to harassment and other threats to their 
safety as a result of being doxed.


 Congress can take a few steps to help local governments, including 
local law enforcement agencies, better mitigate cyber threats. First, 
Congress must ensure the grant programs that help build local cyber 
capacity, such as the Homeland Security Grant Program, are fully 
funded. Congress should also continue to ensure agencies such as DHS's 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have the 
authorities and resources needed to continue programs and efforts 
designed to help law enforcement prevent and respond to cyber attacks.


 Ms. Miller-Meeks. I only have a little bit more time left, 
but I am so glad that you brought up the issues that you 
brought up, because we also have disinformation from--you know, 
from other governments that are not friendly to the United 
States. Hopefully you saw the recent Wall Street Journal 
article talking about both Russia and the Chinese Communist 
Party with their disinformation campaigns on social media to 
exaggerate the side effects from our vaccines for COVID-19. 
This is extraordinarily serious. We know we have to get through 
this pandemic. It is part of--I am sure it has impacted all of 
you and your jobs in emergency preparedness. You know, your 
thoughts on that type of disinformation campaign by foreign 
leaders in the digital or internet realm.
	 Mr. Maples. Thank you for that question. That is a--I hate 
to say it has become part of our wheelhouse in New Jersey.
    The Governor and I spoke very early in the pandemic and we 
realized there was a problem. One of those was a state-
sponsored--and I don't want to get into the specific details--
but a state-sponsored actor started a text message strain that 
started--really started some of the panic around that first 
March time frame. It said essentially that they had a friend 
that is high-ranking at FEMA or the military and they are going 
to kick the doors in and lock the entire country down. That is 
what led us to start saying well, this is a core Homeland 
Security problem. I was getting calls from private-sector 
leaders, Chairmen and Chairwomen, company CEOs, you name it, 
public sector, and people were really concerned about that. 
That was 100 percent a foreign influence misinformation, 
disinformation campaign.
    That led us to the vaccinations, like you said, and really 
across the board. Some of the unrest that we have seen over the 
past year-and-a-half. So on our website at NJOHSP.gov, we have 
got a dedicated web page toward combatting the disinformation 
and misinformation. Again, we have seen this now in New Jersey 
as a core Homeland Security discipline and problem set that we 
have to deal with, and turning that narrative by being 
trustworthy, transparent, direct, with the information. We are 
an apolitical organization, we fight to maintain that 
apolitical nature, and we do that through, again, those 
mechanisms.


Governor, in your view, do you think these changes help to 
more accurately reflect the current threat landscape? If not, 
why not?
    Governor Ige. Thank you so much for that question, 
Chairwoman.
    It definitely does improve the threat landscape. You know, 
as Representative Meeks had asked, the cyber threat is a 
Nation-wide threat because we are all connected. You know, we 
are definitely seeking and encouraging the Congress to dedicate 
a stream of funding to cybersecurity. We are seeing more 
sophisticated threat actors, as Mr. Maples had commented. We 
have nation-state threat actors using misinformation campaigns 
to confuse the residents across all 50 States and territories. 
It becomes more important that these international actors--and 
I think the real threat to the American way of life is no 
business is really prepared to deal with these nation-state 
actors. They are becoming more sophisticated. The cyber 
terrorists from out of country have access to the networks 
within our country. I think most importantly the weakest link 
in the network is where those cyber actors, those bad actors 
will enter the network and wreak havoc. So even the smallest 
county, the smallest business how now has been encouraged to 
embrace the technology and being part of the network, can 
become the weakest link and the area of attack.",Addressing Evolving Threats: Testimonies on Homeland Security Preparedness,"Testimonies from officials and experts highlight the evolving threat landscape faced by the United States, ranging from cybersecurity vulnerabilities to domestic extremism and foreign disinformation campaigns. Discussions emphasize the need for dedicated funding and enhanced efforts to combat these multifaceted challenges and ensure the resilience of the nation's critical infrastructure and democratic institutions."

 In 2020, as the U.S.-Russia bilateral relationship is likely to 
remain severely strained, Open World programs will focus on maintaining 
partnerships, increasing people-to-people contacts in order to counter 
disinformation and to foster greater mutual understanding. We will 
prioritize programs that reinforce long standing partnerships and that 
further newly formed ones, such as sister city relationships and Rotary 
club partnerships. The program will counter anti-American propaganda 
and promote a positive image of the United States by linking 
professionals with their U.S. counterparts and providing a host family 
experience for each participant. Program themes will also focus on 
areas of mutual interest, such as health issues, business and 
innovation, entrepreneurship, education, national parks/conservation, 
and inclusion. Many program themes will also include local legislators 
and those seeking to run for local office.


 Open World programming in Azerbaijan is also aimed at recognizing 
those who are underserved and underrepresented, including the disabled, 
refugees, and Internally Displaced Persons. Elman Suleymanov, who 
participated on a Disability Advocacy and Reform program, received a 
grant for a project that designed and produced a special guide for 
people with visual disabilities. This guide included a printed braille 
alphabet, audio books, and covered the topics of medical first-aid and 
instructions for responses to natural disasters for people with visual 
disabilities. The guide was circulated among people with visual 
disabilities and state libraries. Elman, who is visually impaired, was 
greatly appreciative that he was able to participate on the Open World 
program. He felt that his participation helped him grow as a 
professional and boosted his confidence.
    A fellow extraordinary alumni from the Disability Advocacy and 
Reform program is Nihad Gulamzada. He is the CEO and Founder of the 
first inclusive theatre consisting of actors with disabilities in 
Azerbaijan and the Caucasus. In 2019, Nihad was able to gain government 
support and organize his productions in partnership with various 
ministries. Nihad partnered with fellow Open World alumnus Elman 
Suleymanov by handing out copies of the guide for people with visual 
disabilities to guests of the theater performances. Nihad is currently 
running for Parliament in the February 2020 parliamentary elections.
Belarus
    In 2004, and from 2017 through 2019, the Center hosted 54 delegates 
from Belarus. The program has focused on fostering a stronger civil 
society, economic resilience, issues of good governance and 
transparency, respect for human rights, and countering misinformation. 
Program themes have focused on healthcare, intellectual property 
rights, marketing, tourism, alternative energy, media, and 
entrepreneurship. The year 2020 marks four straight years of Open World 
programs with Belarus.


From 2007 through 2019, the Center hosted 494 delegates from 
Moldova. The Open World program in Moldova has focused on parliamentary 
exchanges, rule of law, economic development, and partnerships, all 
aimed at strengthening institutions, fighting corruption, countering 
misinformation, and developing civil society.
    The outcome of the February 2019 parliamentary elections in Moldova 
produced an unusual coalition government, and resulted in 57 newly 
elected MPs out of the 101 members. The Open World program for 
parliamentarians will continue the dialogue between legislators from 
Moldova and their counterparts in the U.S. Congress. The program 
reinforces effective and democratic governance practices, and allows 
Members of the United States Congress to discuss timely issues such 
European integration, countering disinformation, and combating 
corruption with their colleagues from Moldova. The Open World judge-to-
judge program for Moldova resumed in 2019, after being on hold in 2018 
due to the annulment of the Chisinau Mayoral election results. This 
program pairs Moldovan judges with a U.S. federal judge to share best 
practices in jurisprudence, ethics, and the importance of an 
independent judiciary, all of which are essential to justice sector 
reform in Moldova.


 Before closing this statement about the Open World Leadership 
Center, it is important to talk about the continuing participation of 
Russian delegates once their program is over. Russia continues to play 
a critical role in events in the region, in Europe, and its reach 
extends much further. Kremlin control of media within Russian borders, 
and the very effective disinformation campaign in neighboring states, 
has brought the intended results--strong internal support for the 
Russian president and for his policies; a resurgent pride in Russia's 
expanded role on the world stage; and a reassertion of its spheres of 
influence. A few years ago, the United States had more than 300 active 
exchange programs with Russia. Today there are just a few, and only 
one, the Open World program, has the means to reach throughout this 
vast country and to attract rising leaders who might otherwise eschew a 
U.S.-sponsored program.


 Russia and Ukraine are keys to the future of the region. By 
supporting reformers and Euro-integrationists in Ukraine, by supporting 
those engaged in countering disinformation, and by helping committed 
officials use the laws on decentralization, health, and educational 
reform succeed, we in a small way help balance the overwhelming 
advantage Russia enjoys at this moment. Our intertwined interests and 
rivalries with Russia will not fade, and we need to be smart enough to 
engage the post-Putin generation for they will soon enough influence 
whether their country continues its role as a destabilizing force or 
cooperates with the community of nations in Europe and Eurasia.",Open World Programs Addressing Disinformation and Strengthening Relations in Eurasia,"The Open World Leadership Center's programs in Eurasia, particularly in countries like Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova, and Russia, focus on countering disinformation and fostering mutual understanding through people-to-people exchanges. These initiatives prioritize partnerships, including sister city relationships and Rotary club collaborations, to combat anti-American propaganda and promote positive perceptions of the United States. By engaging professionals and underserved communities like the disabled, refugees, and internally displaced persons, the programs aim to empower individuals, strengthen civil society, and support democratic governance while countering misinformation and enhancing regional stability amid geopolitical challenges."

On January 6, 2021, 8,000 local and Federal law enforcement 
officers were on duty in the District of Columbia. I was told 
during planning sessions that such a force routinely manages 
demonstrations well north of 100,000 demonstrators. That is 
what they are trained, equipped, chartered, and expected to do.
    Many commentators have mischaracterized my instructions and 
Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy's accompanying guidance as somehow 
contributing to the inability of the Guard to respond or, even 
worse, that those instructions somehow enabled the mob to enjoy 
an easy path to the Capitol. That is completely false. We did 
not disarm the National Guard. The request from the Mayor was 
for unarmed support of local law enforcement, and we authorized 
the support she and General Walker requested.


  Mr. Gosar. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
    Outright propaganda and lies are being used to unleash the 
national security state against law-abiding U.S. citizens, 
especially Trump voters. The FBI is fishing through homes of 
veterans and citizens with no criminal records and restricting 
the liberties of individuals that have never been accused of a 
crime.


 Mr. Gosar. I appreciate you, and thank you for your 
service.
    Madam Chairwoman, my constituents demand answers, but the 
truth is being censored and covered up. As a result, the DOJ is 
harassing peaceful patriots across the country. Without 
accurate answers, conspiracies continue to form.


 Mr. Miller. Based on, as Chief Contee said, we are getting 
more information by the day, by the minute, about what 
happened, and to highlight some other observations that were 
made, it's clear now that there were organized--although we're 
going to find out through the Department of Justice process and 
the legal system, it seems clear that there was some sort of 
conspiracy where there were organized assault elements that 
intended to assault the Capitol that day.


 Mr. Miller. I would like to offer--I have reassessed. It is 
not the unitary factor at all. It seems clear there was an 
organized conspiracy with assault elements in place----
    Mr. Lynch. In your written testimony for today----
    Mr. Miller [continuing]. Going to assault regardless of 
what the President said.


 Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Mr. Miller, according to the 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA, Russia 
is responsible for SolarWinds, the largest cyber attack waged 
ever against the U.S. in our history. You are aware of that, 
right?
    Mr. Miller. I thought I was here to discuss unexplained 
delays and unanswered questions of the event of 6 January.
    Mr. Krishnamoorthi. Sir, you said, ``Good on them,'' with 
regard to Russia. Meanwhile, regarding the Department of 
Defense which you headed, you told Vanity Fair, ``This f'ing 
place is rotten.'' I think your comments, Mr. Miller, about 
Russia and the DOD are bizarre and rotten, and I think they 
illustrate unfortunately the problems of the response on 
January 6.


 Mr. Miller. The statement that indeed this was a terrorist 
attack?
    Mr. Raskin. That they used terrorism to stop a specific 
piece of democratic business, fellow Americans beat and 
bloodied their own police, they stormed the Senate floor, they 
tried to hunt down the Speaker of the House, they build a 
gallows and chanted about murdering the Vice President. They 
did this because they have been fed wild falsehoods by the most 
powerful man on Earth because he was angry he had lost an 
election. Do you disagree with any of that?
    Mr. Miller. I agree that it was an act of terrorism.
    Mr. Raskin. OK. Madam Chair, some of our distinguished 
colleagues, including my friend from Louisiana, have been 
invoking the 74 million who voted for Donald Trump. Here is 
what Senate Minority Leader McConnell had to say about that: 
``In recent weeks, our ex-President's associates have tried to 
use the 74 million Americans who voted to reelect him as a kind 
of human shield against criticism. Anyone who decries his awful 
behavior is accused of insulting millions of voters. That is an 
absurd deflection. Seventy-four million Americans did not 
invade the Capitol. Several hundred rioters did. And 74 million 
Americans did not engineer the campaign of disinformation and 
rage that provoked it. One person did and that was Donald 
Trump.''
	 So this is an essential hearing, Madam Chair, but it will 
barely scratch the surface of the questions that need to be 
answered about the violent insurrection against Congress and 
the Constitution to overthrow the results of the 2020 
Presidential election. We need a complete bipartisan, 
multipartisan, nonpartisan, 9/11-style commission to study the 
causes and the events of January 6 and the response to it. But 
our colleagues, alas, have done everything in their power to 
block the formation of a commission, including slandering Black 
Lives Matter, a non-violent movement for justice that they 
continue to lie about with their propaganda. And today we have 
heard different numbers bandied about, 25 people who died in 
Black Lives Matter protests, 19 people who died and so on. A 
lot of the people they are talking about are people who were 
killed by right-wing counterprotesters or provocateurs.


 Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to 
take a moment to correct some of the dangerous rhetoric and 
falsehoods uttered by Republicans during this hearing. You 
would think that they would have learned something. After all, 
it was lies about the 2020 election that led to the January 6 
insurrection in the first place.
    My colleague from Arizona, Mr. Gosar, used his questions 
today to downplay the actions of violent insurrectionists that 
left 140 police officers injured and four people dead. Instead, 
he had the audacity to claim the Capitol Police executed a pro-
Trump rioter who was attempting to breach--who was attempting 
to breach the House chamber.


 Mr. Biggs. And, Mr. Miller, you talked about an ``organized 
conspiracy''--that is the quotes I have from you earlier in 
testimony--about what took place on January 6 in some respects. 
Was it organized, the attack?
    Mr. Miller. I don't know. I think we're going to have to 
find out through forums like this and further investigation, 
but it appears that way based on the communications protocols 
and what-not.


 Mr. Clyde. Oh, absolutely. I agree with that 100 percent. 
You know, but the only insurrection that I have witnessed in my 
lifetime was the one conducted by members of the FBI with 
participants from the DOJ and other agencies under the banner 
of Russia, Russia, Russia.
    High-ranking employees from these Federal agencies and 
members of an independent counsel coordinated and fed a false 
narrative for over two years that the 2016 election was stolen 
and illegitimate. Democrats were on the news almost every night 
saying the evidence is there, and the mainstream media 
amplified the fake news. This was, indeed a very coordinated 
and well-funded effort by a determined group of people to 
overthrow our duly elected President, Donald J. Trump.


 Mr. Cloud. OK, thank you.
    The Speaker also promulgated the false information that an 
officer was killed by a fire extinguisher. This information was 
also used in an impeachment hearing as evidence for 
impeachment. It is beyond me why the Speaker would feel the 
need to lie about either Members of Congress or about the 
officers who serve in our halls. It is tragic for someone 
serving in that capacity.


 President Joe Biden was duly elected in a free and fair 
election, defeating Donald Trump. But baseless conspiracy 
theories and those who encourage them are harmful, in and of 
themselves. But the disinformation surrounding them incited the 
insurrection and continues to harm our democracy. Public 
officials and other leaders have encouraged insurrectionists 
and with raised fists implored conspiracy theorists to hold the 
line or supported them in other ways by implying that Donald 
Trump is really the President.


 Ms. Herrell. OK. Mr. Miller, I would ask you the same 
question. How much--do you feel like the well has been poisoned 
here? I mean, we have had so much fake news, cynical 
politicians, disinformation, far, far from the truth. I mean, 
we heard that Officer Sicknick was killed by a fire 
extinguisher in the riot, but indeed, he died by natural 
causes, a stroke. In fact, that was put out by the D.C. medical 
examiner.
    How much of an impact do you think social media and other 
outlets had on an investigation?
    Mr. Miller. Congresswoman, I have no idea, but I think you 
highlight a very, very important fact. And that's what I was 
trying to highlight that the gentleman from California tagged 
before. Some people are doing it against us very effectively, 
and we need to figure out how to manage this and how to bring 
about some needed changes.
    Ms. Herrell. Yes, I think they call that fake news.
    Mr. Contee, just a question. Capitol Police, are they in 
charge solely of securing the Capitol and protecting it?
    Chief Contee. Yes, they are.


  Audit after audit and court case after court case has 
affirmed the fact that Donald Trump was defeated fairly by 
President Joe Biden. And yet these conspiracy theories 
continue, and they proliferate online, are given oxygen within 
the Republican Party. Many of them have failed to condemn and 
today have expelled one of their own from their ``big tent of 
leadership'' for not subscribing to this lie.
    In the name of this debunked conspiracy theory, violence 
was committed here, and further violence has been promoted 
against other elected officials, including our colleagues.",Congressional Hearing Highlights on January 6 Insurrection Testimonies,"The excerpts from the congressional hearing capture the diverse perspectives and debates surrounding the events of January 6, 2021, and its aftermath.

    So technology has certainly addressed some of the isolation 
problems that people have felt during the pandemic, and look 
how we are communicating today, so there has been a lot of 
important changes that technology and opportunities that 
technology has provided for us, but even before the pandemic, I 
think there were many, many consumers that reported feelings of 
helplessness when it comes to with respect to the digital 
economy.
    You know, on my subcommittee in Energy and Commerce, which 
is the Consumer Protection Subcommittee, we have talked a lot 
about technology and its ups and downs, and we know that big 
tech has actually allowed fraud and fake news and fake reviews 
and counterfeit and stolen products that are thriving on their 
platforms.

regulation, and I think it is pretty clear that we need--that 
that isn't working very well.

 We also need to give adequate attention to our public

 I want to start by asking a question about the 
misinformation and flat-out falsehoods about the coronavirus 
that have been circulating, and amplified. I worry that it's 
being amplified for political reasons, to the point of Senator 
Roberts and others that we don't want to politicize this.
    My question is what is the impact of this misinformation, 
and what should we do about it? I'm sort of looking at Dr. 
Schuchat and Dr. Fauci in particular. I mean, it's embarrassing 
to go through all of the things that have been said on national 
media, including, honestly, by our President.
    Dr. Fauci, it's not true, is it, that this is just like a 
common cold and that we can expect that this is going to be 
gone when the weather warms up? Is that true or not?
    Dr. Fauci. Let me explain. In general, respiratory 
illnesses such as the prototypic influenza virus is seasonal, 
and when the weather gets warmer, as will happen in March, 
April and May, you will inevitably see a marked diminution in 
influenza. The same holds true for other respiratory viruses, 
including some of the common cold coronaviruses.


Senator Smith. We've heard so much misinformation. I mean, 
it's been said that this virus was developed as a tool to wage 
economic war on the United States. It's been said that this is 
part of a strategy to try to bring down the economy. I mean, 
it's ridiculous, and it's harmful.
    Could you as public health professionals comment on why 
this makes it more difficult for us to address this epidemic, 
and what we should do to combat this kind of misinformation?
    Dr. Fauci. I think we need to speak out often and loudly 
about how much nonsense this is. This is not new with 
coronavirus. There are always conspiracy theories when there's 
a new disease that people are afraid of and that is really 
novel to them.
    I have to say, I'm thinking back now about 35 or 37 years 
ago. I sat in this room and tried to explain to the Committee 
then that HIV was not a virus that was developed by the CIA to 
essentially eliminate certain populations. It's crazy, but this 
is what happens when you have outbreaks. There's a lot of 
misinformation.
    Senator Smith. Then there's consequence. My point is that 
there's consequence to this misinformation that makes it more 
difficult for public health professionals to respond and to 
take care of the population in the ways that we need to, and 
that's what worries me.


",Addressing Misinformation in Public Health Education,"The discussion highlights the critical need to combat misinformation surrounding the coronavirus outbreak, emphasizing the importance of public health education. Concerns are raised about the spread of false information and conspiracy theories, which can lead to panic, discrimination, and undermine public health efforts.

Dr. Fauci underscores the necessity of speaking out against misinformation and provides historical context, drawing parallels to past conspiracy theories during disease outbreaks like HIV/AIDS. The consensus is that combating misinformation is essential for effective public health response."

 We have a President who has repeatedly tried to manipulate 
a news cycle, going so far as to falsely suggest he can move 
the election date, and, more insidiously, making baseless 
claims about the security of vote-by-mail. This behavior is in 
service to his own narcissistic political ends, softens the 
turf for dangerous foreign influence campaigns, and puts 
Americans who want to exercise the franchise at risk.


 First, we must prepare Americans for the reality that 
elections will be administered differently this fall. We must 
educate voters about vote-by-mail, its related deadlines, and 
how expanded vote-by-mail might affect the timing of election 
results. We must encourage participation in vote-by-mail while 
inoculating the public from disinformation campaigns aimed at 
undermining confidence in election results.


As States scrambled to administer safe primary elections this 
spring, seemingly administrative decisions related to the number and 
location of polling sites had substantive impacts on people's voting 
rights. Long lines and crowded polling locations in predominantly black 
and brown neighborhoods raised the stress levels in communities 
disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 and police violence and 
underscored that the existence of systemic racism as is an injustice

claims about the security of vote-by-mail.
    This behavior, in service to his own narcissistic political ends, 
softens the turf for dangerous foreign influence campaigns and puts 
Americans who want to exercise the franchise at risk. For the record, 
the President does not have the power to move the date of the November 
election. Moreover, last Friday the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency released a risk assessment of vote-by-mail.
    CISA concluded that while there are risks associated with mail-in 
voting--just as there with every other method of voting--those risks 
can be mitigated. Further, I am not aware of any intelligence 
assessment indicating that foreign actors have expressed interest or 
capability to successfully interfere with vote-by-mail processes. We 
must learn the lessons of our recent elections and do better in 
November.
    First, we must prepare Americans for the reality that elections 
will be administered differently this fall. We must educate voters 
about vote-by-mail, its related deadlines, and how expanded vote-by-
mail might affect the timing of election results. We must encourage 
participation in vote-by-mail while inoculating the public from 
disinformation campaigns aimed at undermining confidence election 
results.


CISA is also working with State and local election 
officials to head off disinformation campaigns engineered by 
adversaries. A key component of this strategy is countering the 
opportunity for adversaries to spread disinformation on remote-
voting procedures and changes in polling locations.
    CISA has assisted State and local officials with methods to 
drive voters to reliable sources of information, and how to 
communicate changes to election procedures, polling locations, 
and times.

 We need to ensure that our elections are run as smoothly as 
possible so that mis- and disinformation is less likely to be 
effective. If our general election is plagued by significant 
problems, inaccurate information is more likely to find a 
receptive audience, as we have seen with Russia and Iran 
already.
    Regardless of how secure our elections are, experts and 
officials are concerned that some voters could dismiss 
November's results as invalid or rigged because of mis- and/or 
disinformation. Voters could argue, for example, that the much-
longer-than-usual time required to count an anticipated surge 
in mail-in ballots is direct evidence of nefarious conduct.
    We must seek to flood the information space with credible, 
consistent election information so that voters are immunized 
against falsehoods. This will admittedly be challenging in 
light of the coronavirus and the constant change it is 
required. But it is doable, particularly, if Federal 
authorities can provide State and local election officials 
additional funding to publicize and explain changes to their 
election processes. It is essential that also partisan politics 
be kept out of election administration to build confidence in 
the integrity of the election process, and it should happen 
long before Election Day.

                 iii. election mis- and disinformation
    Regardless of how secure our elections are, many election experts 
and officials are concerned that some voters could dismiss November's 
results as invalid or rigged because of mis- and/or disinformation. 
Voters could argue, for example, that the much-longer-than-usual time 
required to count an anticipated surge in mail-in ballots is prima 
facie evidence of nefarious conduct. While most of us know that such 
allegations are not true, similar rhetoric is already being amplified 
by foreign adversaries, such as Russia and Iran, to diminish confidence 
in the election results and undermine our democracy.\18\ In response, 
we need to do at least two things.

inaccurate information is more likely to find a receptive audience.
    For example, during the February 3, 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses--
which were administered by political party officials, not election 
officials--the new app that the Iowa Democratic Party used to report 
caucus results did not work as planned,\19\ resulting in a system-wide 
meltdown.\20\ That provided enough of an opening for a conspiracy 
theory to go viral and be amplified by accounts with Russian links. 
This conspiracy theory accused Robby Mook (Hillary Clinton's 2016 
campaign manager) of developing Iowa's mobile app to rig the Democratic 
primary against Senator Bernie Sanders (Secretary Clinton's former 
rival)--even though Mr. Mook had not developed (or even heard of) the 
app.\21\

New funding could also mitigate any cyber or technical-related 
problems that would impact the administration of the general election. 
While jurisdictions in 41 States and the District of Columbia use 
electronic pollbooks (EPBs) to verify voter eligibility at polling 
places, only 12 States and DC appear to require paper back-ups in case 
the EPBs malfunction.\36\ More funds could help more jurisdictions 
obtain paper back-ups for use if their EPBs become inoperable due to a 
cyber attack or technical glitch.\37\ To cite just one other example, 
localities with electronic voting machines could use funding to 
purchase extra provisional ballots in the event that their voting 
machines go down during the general election so that voters don't have 
to wait for extended periods of time following a system failure.\38\

 H.R. 1, the For the People Act.--H.R. 1 includes many extremely 
strong protections for voters, such as on-line voter registration, 
same-day (also known as ``Election Day'') registration, and automatic 
voter registration to ensure that voters can safely and securely 
register to vote during the pandemic. Each of these provisions allows 
for voters to have more opportunities, in the face of challenges 
(brought on by COVID for some, but always in existence for others) to 
be able to vote and have confidence that it will count. The For the 
People Act also includes the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation 
Prevention Act to deter bad actors from trying to spread false 
information about voting. And importantly, the For the People Act 
includes the Voter Empowerment Act, which Congressman Lewis long 
championed. We very much appreciate Chairman Richmond cosponsoring and 
voting for H.R. 1 when it passed the House in March 2019, and we 
continue to strongly urge Senator McConnell to bring it up for a vote 
in the Senate.


  Now, as a couple of notable considerations, and as you 
mentioned the CISA report, the CISA report that was released on 
Friday that talked about the importance of securing vote-by-
mail systems noted that disinformation risks to mail-in voting 
infrastructure and processes is similar to that of in-person 
voting while utilizing different content. Threat actors may 
leverage limited understanding regarding mail-in voting to 
mislead and confuse the public. This includes casting doubt 
without evidence about the mail ballot process, thus combating 
disinformation and misinformation is a critical aspect of 
election officials' work to secure the election. Expanding 
vote-at-home options is nonpartisan and supported by leaders on 
both sides of the aisle.


 Our democracy functions when every eligible voter is able 
to exercise their right to vote. Voters have already chosen to 
vote at home in record numbers in the primaries, and they will 
continue to do so.
    Our democracy is essential, and we need to be sure that our 
systems are secure from any interference and any misinformation 
and disinformation as noted in the CISA report on Friday.
    No election system is perfect, and this is why it is 
critical to continually review and improve systems by enhancing 
security access transparency, particularly in this 
unprecedented time. An example of the necessary improvement is 
the implementation ballot tracking system that many States are 
working on right now. Another example is advanced auditing 
techniques, such as risk-limiting audits. We cannot settle for 
when this moment and this unprecedented crisis calls us to do 
better.


 Notable considerations:
    1. As noted in the CISA Report released on Friday, ``Disinformation 
        risk to mail-in voting infrastructure and processes is similar 
        to that of in-person voting while utilizing different content. 
        Threat actors may leverage limited understanding regarding 
        mail-in voting to mislead and confuse the public.''
        a. This includes casting doubt without evidence about the mail 
            ballot process.
    Thus, combatting disinformation and misinformation is a critical 
        aspect of election officials' work. Expanding vote-at-home 
        options is nonpartisan and supported by leaders on both sides 
        of the aisle.


  In the area of cyber awareness and education, a set of 
broad initiatives has enhanced elections officials' 
understanding of cyber attacks and what they should do to 
assess their organization's cyber readiness. Conferences, 
webinars, tabletop exercises, State-sponsored cyber education 
events, educational materials, and situational updates from EI-
ISAC, as well as on-line courses sponsored by DHS's CISA 
organization, the EAC, and third-party organizations, have 
resulted in a dramatic improvement in the cybersecurity 
awareness of elections official.
    In addition to Federally-funded activities, CIS continues 
to invest our own funds and seeks private grant support to 
develop best practice guidance and tools for elections 
officials.
    While elections officials are not cybersecurity experts, 
they now better understand the nature of cyber threats, the 
available technical solutions, and what to do in response to a 
cyber event.


  I close by respectfully recommending that Congress continue 
to emphasize the importance of collaboration and cyber 
technology innovation. I also encourage you to focus on the 
attention on this and disinformation in American elections, 
major vulnerability through November, and beyond.
    In this last period, CIS has developed a misinformation 
reporting portal for elections officials in order to simplify 
reporting of elections-related lists and disinformation. We 
piloted the system with elections officials in 5 States, and 
have engaged with DHS, NASS, NASED to promote this capability 
to social media platform. We believe that this capability will 
be a valuable tool of increasing visibility of elections-
related mis- and disinformation. This concludes my oral 
remarks, I look forward to your questions.


 Misinformation Reporting Portal Pilot.\9\ CIS is currently 
producing a better means for election officials to report election 
infrastructure misinformation and disinformation to the social media 
platforms for their investigation and adjudication. Currently, a 
limited set of election officials can report to Facebook and Twitter 
using the means provided directly by the social media platform. 
Elections officials must pre-register with the platform and report 
independently to each one. CIS is working to facilitate a single 
reporting portal where election officials can report the suspected 
misinformation and disinformation once, and have it distributed to the 
various social media platforms. We have been working closely with DHS, 
NASS, and NASED, along with 5 States to vet and promote this concept to 
the social media platforms.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ The RABET-V and Misinformation Reporting Portal are projects 
being funded by the nonprofit Democracy Fund.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Misinformation Reporting Portal will provide elections 
officials with a single place (i.e., the portal) for reporting mis- and 
disinformation across multiple social media platforms with a 
streamlined, consistent user experience. In addition, the entire 
elections community will have visibility of what's going on with mis- 
and disinformation in the elections community within and outside their 
jurisdictions, including to see trends and be able to strategically 
respond. The portal will also streamline and standardize reporting for 
the social media organizations. In addition, voters will have the 
benefit of more rapid correction of erroneous information, leading to 
improved voter confidence.
        (5) three recommendations to continue securing elections
    While much progress has been made over the last 4 years, we know 
that the threat remains, and, as a Nation, we must continue to address 
these new risks and vulnerabilities. We respectfully recommend 3 
courses of action to keep our elections safe and secure. We must: (1) 
Continue to emphasize the importance of collaboration and foster 
collaboration across all elections stakeholders; (2) continue to 
innovate and leverage evolving security and applicable commercial 
technologies; and (3) consider how best to address the impact of mis- 
and disinformation on American elections.


 Address the impact of mis- and disinformation on elections.--While 
we have made great strides in improving resilience against cyber 
threats, perhaps the biggest challenge that we face as a Nation going 
forward is how we address the impact of mis- and disinformation on 
elections. While we treasure our rights granted to all citizens by the 
First Amendment, the power of social media in shaping opinions and 
attitudes is expanding rapidly. CIS is working to help address the 
challenge of identifying and reporting deliberate or accidental 
misinformation or disinformation that might prevent voters from 
exercising their right to vote. This is a first step. However, the 
broader challenge is to establish norms and conventions that will help 
voters understand what is factual and what is opinion or even 
deliberate attempts to mislead. We would encourage Congress to take an 
incremental approach to addressing this challenge.


 I think the second thing that is really worth noting, 
though, is that--it was pointed out in this report is also the 
notion that if people spread mis- and disinformation about the 
vote-by-mail process, if they say that the process is easily 
rigged, that is the kind of thing that can be easily amplified 
by foreign adversaries.


  The fact is, there is not a single State that is all vote-
by-mail, or universal vote-by-mail, even though those terms get 
used a lot. The States that do this mail-in ballot and still 
preserve in-person voting options, should voters want to do 
that. So you really have all choices on the table.
    But I was struck in the CISA report that came out, I think 
it included many of the best practices that my organization has 
recommended, but also that many States have actually adopted in 
recent years with regards to the vote-by-mail program. I--what 
struck me in the CISA guidance also was the highlight for 
disinformation and misinformation as being a critical risk to 
our elections systems. That it goes--that is true for in-person 
voting, it is true for early voting, and it is true for the 
vote-by-mail program.


The Cyberspace Solarium Commission also made several strong 
recommendations regarding media literacy and civics education 
and ways to build resiliency to disinformation campaigns.
    We have seen some nascent efforts at the Federal level. For 
instance, CISA's principle, CISA's, they call it, pineapple 
pizza campaign. But the commissioners believe that much more 
needs to be done, that some level of dis- or misinformation is 
inevitable, given our commitment as a society to free speech.


Although my focus and my organization's focus is on 
cybersecurity, I would echo the remarks that you made and 
endorse the recommendations made by the Solarium Commission.
    My assessment is, when I look at the risks that we have to 
the voting process, today I think that the potential of mis- 
and disinformation having an impact on the voting is greater in 
many regards than the potential of cyber threats.
    So I think the approach that is recommended by the Solarium 
Commission, in part, to improve awareness among the public of 
mis- and disinformation, to help, especially our youth, begin 
to understand how to look at social media and how to look at 
multiple sources of information, I think is particularly 
important.


 Ms. McReynolds. Sure, I can jump in there. I agree with 
endorsing that commission's report. I think civics and 
disinformation, security, all of these things are really going 
to be life-long things that we are going have to adjust and 
learn to.
    I am actually a single mom of two. When my ballot comes 
every election, it is a civics lesson for my 7- and 9-year-old, 
and they understand very clearly how to find good information 
about the voting process and we walk through that every single 
time.
    I think in terms of the EAC, again, this is going to be a--
it is a continuum of improvements over time, and we are going 
to have threats that we face this year that are going to be 
different than next year.
    But this misinformation and disinformation has been 
plaguing the election system for the past few years and we 
haven't come up with a very good solution.
    So I think civics education, educating voters about how to 
find good information and how to find trusted sources of 
information, is going to be absolutely critical. Then 
continually improving how we identify that, how we create 
systems that can flag those issues so that voters can clearly 
get the information that they need.


 I think there are a few things that are worth noting. No. 
1, we know that there are other countries that have done this 
in some respects better than we have. We can look to countries 
like Sweden and the Netherlands who also have been dealing with 
sort-of foreign interference threats for some time, who have 
more comprehensive approaches to deal with some of the threats 
that are outlined in terms of mis- and disinformation.


The Constitution also acknowledges that local elections and 
State elections are that of those jurisdictions, but it does 
not deny Congress the right to involve itself by law or 
regulation, which I believe is extremely important in the 
process of which we are dealing with at this moment.
    It is important to give confidence to the American people 
so that misinformation and disinformation and voter suppression 
will not keep the majority of Americans, all of Americans, from 
the right to vote.


I think we can be buoyed by the fact that elections 
officials around the country uniformly have responded to the 
misinformation that the President has shared with the right 
information.
    I think what is important, and as we speak about elections 
going forward, is not to be thinking about defensive 
procedures, but offensive. We need to engage our communities in 
the civic education and inoculation that would protect them 
from being affected by this misinformation.


 I think the second piece that I think is worth noting 
really quickly is that it is really important that the 
information from the intelligence and law enforcement community 
about the threats as much as possible is being shared with 
State election officials and subsequently with the American 
public so that as much as possible the American public has the 
opportunity to prepare accordingly, whether it is the 
misinformation and any other threats.


",Addressing Misinformation and Disinformation in American Elections,"The text discusses the challenges posed by misinformation and disinformation in American elections, particularly regarding mail-in voting and election security. It highlights efforts to educate voters, combat false information, and improve election systems to ensure fair and secure elections. Various initiatives and recommendations are presented, including collaboration between election stakeholders, enhancing cybersecurity awareness, and promoting media literacy. The importance of civics education, reliable information sources, and sharing intelligence with state election officials is emphasized to safeguard the electoral process against manipulation and foreign interference."
